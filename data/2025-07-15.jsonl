We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model\ninto a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct\nSEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over\n260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases.\nWe evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on\nthis benchmark.

A comprehensive analysis is needed to uncover\ncritical factors affecting detection and guide improvements in model design and\ndeployment. In this paper, we present VulTegra, a novel evaluation framework\nthat conducts a multidimensional comparison of scratch-trained and\npre-trained-based DL models for vulnerability detection. VulTegra reveals that\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors still suffer from low consistency, limited\nreal-world capabilities, and scalability challenges. Contrary to common belief,\npre-trained models are not consistently better than scratch-trained models but\nexhibit distinct strengths in specific contexts.Importantly, our study exposes\nthe limitations of relying solely on CWE-based classification and identifies\nkey factors that significantly affect model performance.

While LLMs\nlike GPT-4 have shown promise across a range of tasks, their ability to\nreplicate nuanced human judgements remains under scrutiny. We conducted four\npsycholinguistic studies (on emergent meanings, valence shifts, verb choice in\nemotional contexts, and sentence-emoji associations) first with human\nparticipants and then replicated the same tasks using an LLM. Results across\nall studies show a striking convergence between human and AI responses, with\nstatistical analyses (e.g., Spearman's rho = .73-.96) indicating strong\ncorrelations in both rating patterns and categorical choices. While minor\ndivergences were observed in some cases, these did not alter the overall\ninterpretative outcomes. These findings offer compelling evidence that LLMs can\naugment traditional human-based experimentation, enabling broader-scale studies\nwithout compromising interpretative validity. This convergence not only\nstrengthens the empirical foundation of prior human-based findings but also\nopens possibilities for hypothesis generation and data expansion through AI.\nUltimately, our study supports the use of LLMs as credible and informative\ncollaborators in linguistic inquiry."}

This three-dimensional\nframework allows for a richer and more cognitively grounded approach to\nmetaphor interpretation in computational systems. At the first level, metaphors\nare annotated through basic conceptual elements. At the second level, we model\nconceptual combinations, linking components to emergent meanings.

Notably, even when graph structures\nare embedded within textual descriptions, LLMs can still effectively answer\nrelated questions. This raises a fundamental question: How can a decoder-only\nTransformer architecture understand underlying graph structures? To address\nthis, we start with the substructure extraction task, interpreting the inner\nmechanisms inside the transformers and analyzing the impact of the input\nqueries. Specifically, through both empirical results and theoretical analysis,\nwe present Induced Substructure Filtration (ISF), a perspective that captures\nthe substructure identification in the multi-layer transformers. We further\nvalidate the ISF process in LLMs, revealing consistent internal dynamics across\nlayers. Building on these insights, we explore the broader capabilities of\nTransformers in handling diverse graph types. Specifically, we introduce the\nconcept of thinking in substructures to efficiently extract complex composite\npatterns, and demonstrate that decoder-only Transformers can successfully\nextract substructures from attributed graphs, such as molecular graphs.\nTogether, our findings offer a new insight on how sequence-based Transformers\nperform the substructure extraction task over graph data."}

With this\ncorpus we compare LLM actions with original human-generated clarification\nquestions, examining how both humans and LLMs act in the case of ambiguity. We\nfind that there is only a weak link between ambiguity and humans producing\nclarification questions in these dialogues, and low correlation between humans\nand LLMs. Humans hardly ever produce clarification questions for referential\nambiguity, but often do so for task-based uncertainty.

These features are then matched through advanced semantic algorithms to\nidentify the best candidates efficiently. Our approach integrates seamlessly\ninto existing RPA pipelines, automating resume parsing, job matching, and\ncandidate notifications. Extensive performance benchmarking shows that MLAR\noutperforms the leading RPA platforms, including UiPath and Automation\nAnywhere, in high-volume resume-processing tasks.

We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework\nthat combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer.\nMoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter\nefficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by\ndynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This\nallows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still\nactive at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency\nby selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core\nmechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the\nfirst recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory\nfootprint.

Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also\nserve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by\nother models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking\ndifferent LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking.\nHowever, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its\neffectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of\ndedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a\nbenchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and\nunit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform\nnon-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even\nrelatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially\ntrained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still\nexhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise\njudging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can\nsubstantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests\nwritten by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in\nperformance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and\nconsistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal\nprompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge.
