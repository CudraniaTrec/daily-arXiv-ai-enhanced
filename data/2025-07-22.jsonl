Running AI workloads efficiently on these devices\nrequires libraries of optimized kernels. Creating efficient kernels demands\nexpertise in domain-specific C++ with vector intrinsics and in-depth knowledge\nof the target architecture. Unlike GPU programming, which has had years to\nmature, NPU programming is new, with smaller and more fragmented developer\ncommunities across hardware platforms. This fragmentation poses a challenge\nwhen utilizing LLMs to assist in writing NPU kernels, as domain-specific\noptimized code examples are underrepresented in LLM pre-training data.\n  In this paper we introduce NPUEval -- a benchmark for writing and evaluating\nNPU kernels, consisting of 102 common operators for machine learning workloads.\nWe evaluate LLM generated code on actual hardware based on both functional\ncorrectness and vectorization efficiency using open source compiler tools\ntargeting the AMD NPU. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art LLMs with a mix\nof proprietary and open-weight models. Latest reasoning models like DeepSeek\nR1, show promising results achieving out-of-the-box 50%+ vectorization on\nselect kernels.

Existing formal verification\ntechniques focus on individual PLC programs in isolation, often neglecting\ninteractions with physical environments and network communication between\ncontrollers. This limitation poses significant challenges in analyzing\nreal-world industrial systems, where continuous dynamics and communication\ndelays play a critical role. In this paper, we present a unified formal\nframework that integrates discrete PLC semantics, networked communication, and\ncontinuous physical behaviors. To mitigate state explosion, we apply partial\norder reduction, significantly reducing the number of explored states while\nmaintaining correctness. Our framework enables precise analysis of PLC-driven\nsystems with continuous dynamics and networked communication."}

It\ninvolves breaking down the input into units that are later passed to the\nlanguage model stack to learn high-dimensional representations used in various\ncontexts, from classification to generation. However, the output of these\ntokenizers is often longer than that traditionally used in compilers and\ninterpreters. This could result in undesirable effects, such as increased\ncomputational overhead. In this work, we investigate the effect of merging the\nhidden representations of subtokens that belong to the same semantic unit, such\nas subtokens that form a single identifier. We propose two strategies: one\nbased on averaging the representations and another that leverages a\nlearning-based approach. Both methods can be seamlessly integrated with\nexisting language models for code. We conduct experiments using six language\nmodels for code: CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, UniXCoder, CdoeT5, CodeT5+ (220M),\nand CodeT5+ (770M), across three software engineering tasks: vulnerability\ndetection, code classification, and code translation. Results show that these\nstrategies can reduce the number of floating-point operations by $1\\%$ to\n$19\\%$. Regarding downstream performance, the most significant degradation was\nobserved in the vulnerability detection task, where the F1 score decreased by\n$1.82$ points compared to the baseline. In contrast, for code translation, we\nobserved an improvement of $2.47$ points in CodeBLEU. This work contributes to\nthe broader effort of improving language models for code across multiple\ndimensions, including both computational efficiency and downstream performance."}

For more complex data sharing scenarios,\nwhere consent might not be sufficient, many parties rely on contracts. Before a\ncontract is signed, it must undergo the process of contract negotiation within\nthe contract lifecycle, which consists of negotiating the obligations\nassociated with the contract. Contract compliance verification (CCV) provides a\nmeans to verify whether a contract is GDPR-compliant, i.e., adheres to legal\nobligations and there are no violations. The rise of knowledge graph (KG)\nadoption, enabling semantic interoperability using well-defined semantics,\nallows CCV to be applied on KGs. In the scenario of different participants\nnegotiating obligations, there is a need for data consistency to ensure that\nCCV is done correctly. Recent work introduced the automated contracting tool\n(ACT), a KG-based and ODRL-employing tool for GDPR CCV, which was developed in\nthe Horizon 2020 project smashHit (https://smashhit.eu). Although the tool\nreports violations with respect to obligations, it had limitations in verifying\nand ensuring compliance, as it did not use an interoperable semantic formalism,\nsuch as SHACL, and did not support users in resolving data inconsistencies. In\nthis work, we propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations of ACT. We\nsemi-automatically resolve CCV inconsistencies by providing repair strategies,\nwhich automatically propose (optimal) solutions to the user to re-establish\ndata consistency and thereby support them in managing GDPR-compliant contract\nlifecycle data. We have implemented the approach, integrated it into ACT and\ntested its correctness and performance against basic CCV consistency\nrequirements."}

By combining multi-modal feedback (e.g.,\nsynthesis reports, timing diagrams) with PPA aware prompting, VeriOpt achieves\nPPA-efficient code generation without sacrificing functional correctness.\nExperimental results demonstrate up to 88% reduction in power, 76% reduction in\narea and 73% improvement in timing closure compared to baseline LLM-generated\nRTL, validated using industry standard EDA tools.

However, existing code-generation\nbenchmarks focus on only scalar code, and it is unclear how LLMs perform in\ngenerating vectorized code using SIMD intrinsics. To fill this gap, we propose\nSimdBench, the first code benchmark specifically designed for SIMD-intrinsic\ncode generation, comprising 136 carefully crafted tasks and targeting five\nrepresentative SIMD intrinsics: SSE (x86 Streaming SIMD Extension), AVX (x86\nAdvanced Vector Extension), Neon (ARM Advanced SIMD Extension), SVE (ARM\nScalable Vector Extension), and RVV (RISC-V Vector Extension). We conduct a\nsystematic evaluation (measuring both correctness and performance) of 18\nrepresentative LLMs on SimdBench, resulting in a series of novel and insightful\nfindings. Our evaluation results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a universal\ndecrease in pass@k during SIMD-intrinsic code generation compared to\nscalar-code generation. Our in-depth analysis highlights promising directions\nfor the further advancement of LLMs in the challenging domain of SIMD-intrinsic\ncode generation. SimdBench is fully open source at\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/SimdBench-1B3F/ to benefit the broader\nresearch community."}

Substantial methods have been proposed to detect code clones, but\nthey fall short in capturing code semantics or relying on language-specific\nanalyzers. Inspired by the remarkable success of AlphaFold in predicting\nthree-dimensional protein structures from protein sequences, in this paper, we\nleverage AlphaFold for code clone detection based on the insight that protein\nsequences and token sequences share a common linear sequential structure. In\nparticular, we propose AlphaCC, which represents code fragments as token\nsequences to ensure multi-language applicability and adapts AlphaFold's\nsequence-to-structure modeling capability to infer code semantics. The pipeline\nof AlphaCC goes through three steps. First, AlphaCC transforms each input code\nfragment into a token sequence and, motivated by AlphaFold's use of multiple\nsequence alignment (MSA) to enhance contextual understanding, constructs an MSA\nfrom lexically similar token sequences. Second, AlphaCC adopts a modified\nattention-based encoder based on AlphaFold to model dependencies within and\nacross token sequences. Finally, unlike AlphaFold's protein structure\nprediction task, AlphaCC computes similarity scores between token sequences\nthrough a late interaction strategy and performs binary classification to\ndetermine code clone pairs. Comprehensive evaluations on three language-diverse\ndatasets demonstrate AlphaCC's applicability across multiple programming\nlanguages. On two semantic clone detection datasets, it consistently\noutperforms all baselines, showing strong semantic understanding. Moreover,\nAlphaCC maintains competitive efficiency, enabling practical usage in\nlarge-scale clone detection tasks."}

These tests are crucial not\nonly for ensuring patches work, but also for helping developers understand how\nvulnerabilities can be exploited. Generating PoV tests is a challenging\nproblem, requiring reasoning about the flow of control and data through deeply\nnested levels of a program.\n  We present FaultLine, an LLM agent workflow that uses a set of carefully\ndesigned reasoning steps, inspired by aspects of traditional static and dynamic\nprogram analysis, to automatically generate PoV test cases. Given a software\nproject with an accompanying vulnerability report, FaultLine 1) traces the flow\nof an input from an externally accessible API (\"source\") to the \"sink\"\ncorresponding to the vulnerability, 2) reasons about the conditions that an\ninput must satisfy in order to traverse the branch conditions encountered along\nthe flow, and 3) uses this reasoning to generate a PoV test case in a\nfeedback-driven loop. FaultLine does not use language-specific static or\ndynamic analysis components, which enables it to be used across programming\nlanguages.\n  To evaluate FaultLine, we collate a challenging multi-lingual dataset of 100\nknown vulnerabilities in Java, C and C++ projects.

In this paper, we initially demonstrate that supervised\nfine-tuning for building critic modules (which is widely adopted in current\nsolutions) fails to genuinely enhance models' critique abilities, producing\nsuperficial critiques with insufficient reflections and verifications. To\nunlock the unprecedented critique capabilities, we propose RefCritic, a\nlong-chain-of-thought critic module based on reinforcement learning with dual\nrule-based rewards: (1) instance-level correctness of solution judgments and\n(2) refinement accuracies of the policy model based on critiques, aiming to\ngenerate high-quality evaluations with actionable feedback that effectively\nguides model refinement. We evaluate RefCritic on Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct and\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B across five benchmarks.

Thus, integrating an unspoken thought\nprocess into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking\nfor SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT\nreasoning can be arbitrarily long. To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a\nnovel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken\nreasoning chunks and spoken response chunks. Since the audio duration of a\nchunk of spoken response is much longer than the time to generate the tokens in\na chunk of spoken response, we use the remaining free time to generate the\nunspoken reasoning tokens. When a chunk of audio is played to the user, the\nmodel continues to generate the next unspoken reasoning chunk, achieving\nsimultaneous thinking and talking.

AlgoSimBench consists of 1317\nproblems, annotated with 231 distinct fine-grained algorithm tags, from which\nwe curate 402 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), where each question presents\none algorithmically similar problem alongside three textually similar but\nalgorithmically dissimilar distractors. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs\nstruggle to identify ASPs, with the best-performing model (o3-mini) achieving\nonly 65.9% accuracy on the MCQ task. To address this challenge, we propose\nattempted solution matching (ASM), a novel method for improving problem\nsimilarity detection. On our MCQ task, ASM yields an absolute accuracy\nimprovement of 6.7% to 11.7% across different models. We also evaluated code\nembedding models and retrieval methods on similar problem identification. While\nthe adversarial selection of problems degrades the performance to be less than\nrandom, we found that simply summarizing the problem to remove narrative\nelements eliminates the effect, and combining ASM with a keyword-prioritized\nmethod, BM25, can yield up to 52.2% accuracy.

Through detailed analysis,\nwe show that Supernova achieves 90% of the performance of 1B-parameter models\nwhile using 53% fewer parameters and requiring only 100B training tokens--an\norder of magnitude less than competing models. Our findings challenge the\nprevailing scaling paradigm, demonstrating that architectural efficiency and\ntokenization quality can compensate for reduced parameter counts."}

However, previous RLVR algorithms often apply uniform training\nsignals to all tokens, without considering the different roles of low-entropy\nknowledge-related tokens and high-entropy reasoning-related tokens. Some recent\nmethods try to separate these token types by gradient masking or asynchronous\nupdates, but these approaches may break semantic dependencies in the model\noutput and hinder effective learning. In this work, we propose Archer, an\nentropy-aware RLVR approach with dual-token constraints and synchronous\nupdates. Specifically, our method applies weaker KL regularization and higher\nclipping thresholds to reasoning tokens to encourage exploration, while using\nstronger constraints on knowledge tokens to maintain factual knowledge.\nExperimental results on several mathematical reasoning and code generation\nbenchmarks show that our approach significantly outperforms previous RLVR\nmethods, reaching or exceeding state-of-the-art performance among models of\ncomparable size.

Nevertheless, their huge energy demand and\nslow processing still a bottleneck for further increasing quality while also\nmaking the models accessible to everyone. To solve this bottleneck, we will\ninvestigate how reservoir computing performs on natural text processing, which\ncould enable fast and energy efficient hardware implementations. Studies\ninvestigating the use of reservoir computing as a language model remain sparse.\nIn this paper, we compare three distinct approaches for character-level\nlanguage modeling, two different reservoir computing approaches, where only an\noutput layer is trainable, and the well-known transformer-based architectures,\nwhich fully learn an attention-based sequence representation. We explore the\nperformance, computational cost and prediction accuracy for both paradigms by\nequally varying the number of trainable parameters for all models. Using a\nconsistent pipeline for all three approaches, we demonstrate that transformers\nexcel in prediction quality, whereas reservoir computers remain highly\nefficient reducing the training and inference speed. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate two types of reservoir computing: a traditional reservoir with a\nstatic linear readout, and an attention-enhanced reservoir that dynamically\nadapts its output weights via an attention mechanism. Our findings underline\nhow these paradigms scale and offer guidelines to balance resource constraints\nwith performance."}

Similarly, recent reasoning-focused bilingual large\nlanguage models (LLMs) with strong capabilities in both languages exhibit\nlanguage mixing--alternating languages within their chain of thought.\nDiscouraging this behavior in DeepSeek-R1 was found to degrade accuracy,\nsuggesting that language mixing may benefit reasoning. In this work, we study\nlanguage switching in Chinese-English bilingual reasoning models. We identify\nreinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) as the critical training\nstage that leads to language mixing. We demonstrate that language mixing can\nenhance reasoning: enforcing monolingual decoding reduces accuracy by 5.6\npercentage points on math reasoning tasks. Additionally, a lightweight probe\ncan be trained to predict whether a potential language switch would benefit or\nharm reasoning, and when used to guide decoding, increases accuracy by up to\n6.25 percentage points. Our findings suggest that language mixing is not merely\na byproduct of multilingual training, but is a strategic reasoning behavior."}

To\nhelp bridge this gap, we present 3LM, a suite of three benchmarks designed\nspecifically for Arabic. The first is a set of STEM-related question-answer\npairs, naturally sourced from Arabic textbooks and educational worksheets. The\nsecond consists of synthetically generated STEM questions, created using the\nsame sources. The third benchmark focuses on code generation, built through a\ncareful translation of two widely used code benchmarks, incorporating a\nhuman-in-the-loop process with several rounds of review to ensure high-quality\nand faithful translations.

By implementing a global exception hook architecture with pyttsx3\ntext-to-speech conversion and Tkinter-based GUI visualization, the solution\ndelivers multimodal error feedback through parallel auditory and visual\nchannels. Empirical evaluation demonstrates 37% reduced cognitive load (p<0.01,\nn=50) compared to traditional stack-trace debugging, while enabling 78% faster\nerror identification through vocalized exception classification and\ncontextualization. The system achieves sub-1.2 second voice latency with under\n18% CPU overhead during exception handling, vocalizing error types and\nconsequences while displaying interactive tracebacks with documentation deep\nlinks. Criteria validate compatibility across Python 3.7+ environments on\nWindows, macOS, and Linux platforms. Needing only two lines of integration\ncode, the plugin significantly boosts availability for aesthetically impaired\ndesigners and supports multitasking workflows through hands-free error medical\ndiagnosis. Educational applications show particular promise, with pilot studies\nindicating 45% faster debugging skill acquisition among novice programmers.\nFuture development will incorporate GPT-based repair suggestions and real-time\nmultilingual translation to further advance auditory debugging paradigms.
