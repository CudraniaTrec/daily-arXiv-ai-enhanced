Despite\nits significance, many previous computational results for the Ramsey $R(3, k)$\nproblem such as $R(3, 8)$ and $R(3, 9)$ lack formal verification. To address\nthis issue, we use the software MathCheck to generate certificates for Ramsey\nproblems $R(3, 8)$ and $R(3, 9)$ (and symmetrically $R(8, 3)$ and $R(9, 3)$) by\nintegrating a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver with a computer algebra\nsystem (CAS). Our SAT+CAS approach significantly outperforms traditional\nSAT-only methods, demonstrating an improvement of several orders of magnitude\nin runtime. For instance, our SAT+CAS approach solves $R(3, 8)$ (resp., $R(8,\n3)$) sequentially in 59 hours (resp., in 11 hours), while a SAT-only approach\nusing state-of-the-art CaDiCaL solver times out after 7 days. Additionally, in\norder to be able to scale to harder Ramsey problems $R(3, 9)$ and $R(9, 3)$ we\nfurther optimized our SAT+CAS tool using a parallelized cube-and-conquer\napproach. Our results provide the first independently verifiable certificates\nfor these Ramsey numbers, ensuring both correctness and completeness of the\nexhaustive search process of our SAT+CAS tool."}

Recent research has\naddressed this challenge using domain-specific languages to specify normative\nrequirements as rules, whose consistency can then be analyzed with formal\nmethods. Nevertheless, these approaches often present the results from formal\nverification tools in a way that is inaccessible to non-technical users.

Recently, metamorphic testing\nthat defines Metamorphic Relations (MRs) has been widely applied to evaluate\nthe robustness of LLM executions.

Most extant LLM testing studies are limited to automatically\ngenerating test cases (i.e., MRs) to enhance failure detection.

Moreover, our approach covers the\ncombinatorial perturbations in MRs, facilitating the expansion of test space in\nthe robustness assessment. We have developed a search process and implemented\nfour search algorithms: Single-GA, NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D with novel\nencoding to solve the MR selection problem in the LLM robustness testing.

One of the most effective\napproaches involves utilizing high-quality data generated by powerful models.\nHowever, such models often fail to fully comply with complex instructions in a\nsingle generation. To address this limitation, iterative revision methods have\nbeen introduced. Nevertheless, as the number of data points and revision\niterations increases, the associated monetary costs grow significantly. As a\nresource-efficient alternative, methods have been proposed that leverage\nhigh-performance evaluation tools to compensate for the limited self-evaluation\ncapabilities of open-source LLMs. However, these approaches often lead to a\ndegradation in output quality due to excessive revision. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose Re5, a self-evaluation and revision framework designed\nto enhance instruction-following performance while preserving the quality of\nthe generated content. Re5 extracts task and constraint components from user\ninstructions, performs structural evaluations to prevent error accumulation,\nand applies fine-grained constraint-specific content evaluations followed by\nselective revisions. This process ensures precise and quality-preserving\nimprovements. The final high-quality outputs are used for alignment tuning,\nenabling long-term alignment improvements through a data-centric iterative\nrefinement loop. Experimental results demonstrate that Re5 achieves\ninstruction-following performance comparable to models trained on data\ngenerated by GPT-4o-mini, a high-performance model, even with a small amount of\ndata while maintaining response quality with a 64.24%-win rate over the\nnon-revised initial responses.

However, in tasks such\nas text matching, fine-tuned smaller models often yield more effective\ndomain-specific representations, as they focus on optimizing the similarity of\ninput pairs. To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the\nrich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge\ndistillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM. Specifically, we address the\narchitectural gap between decoder-only LLMs and smaller encoder-based models by\nreinterpreting LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder\ngenerates compressed representations, while the decoder maps them to the output\nspace. During training, the encoder produces representations and their\nsimilarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the\nteacher, using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach.\nThe MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, and\nadaptively handles the internal differences within positive and negative\nsamples. Our paradigm requires only a reasonably good-performing SLM, allowing\nthe LLM to achieve improved performance.

We evaluate multiple open-source\nLLMs on both AFG and AFV using the original FActScore benchmark, reporting\nBERTScore-F1 for AFG and Error Rate relative to human annotations for AFV. Our\nresults show that open models can approximate the performance of closed-source\nsystems, with Gemma achieving the best overall performance, and our final setup\nobtains a 0.99 Pearson correlation with the original FActScore experiments.\nOpenFActScore promotes transparency, reproducibility, and cost-effective\nevaluation, and is available at: https://github.com/lflage/OpenFActScore."}

Furthermore, these benchmarks suffer from limited\ncontrollability in question positioning and reliability issues in their\ngenerated test cases. To address these limitations, we present CorePipe, a\nfully automated pipeline that converts repositories into comprehensive test\ncases, and introduce CoreCodeBench, a configurable multi-scenario\nrepository-level benchmark. To simulate real engineering scenarios, CorePipe\ngenerates three types of atomic questions (Development, BugFix, and Test-Driven\nDevelopment) specifically targeting core code segments. These atomic questions\nare further combined into three types of composite questions, with difficulty\nlevels flexibly adjusted through hyperparameter tuning. CoreCodeBench provides\na comprehensive and extensive repository-level benchmark to investigate the\napplicability of LLMs in real-world engineering projects. Experiments with 16\nLLMs across diverse scenarios reveal varying capabilities and offer\nmulti-dimensional insights into LLM performance in engineering contexts. The\ncode for CorePipe is available at\nhttps://github.com/AGI-Eval-Official/CoreCodeBench, and the data for\nCoreCodeBench can be accessed at\nhttps://huggingface.co/collections/tubehhh/corecodebench-68256d2faabf4b1610a08caa."}
