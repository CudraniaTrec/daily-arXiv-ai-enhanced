Therefore, it is crucial\nto determine whether a given input could produce such errors. Researchers tend\nto take the results of high-precision floating-point programs as oracles for\ndetecting floating-point errors, which introduces two main limitations: (1)\ndifficulty of implementation and (2) prolonged execution time.

Recent approaches such as\nCUP and HebCup have attempted automatic comment updating using neural\nsequence-to-sequence models and heuristic rules, respectively. However, these\nmethods can miss or misinterpret crucial information during comment updating,\nresulting in inaccurate comments, and they often struggle with complex update\nscenarios. Given these challenges, a promising direction lies in leveraging\nlarge language models (LLMs), which have shown impressive performance in\nsoftware engineering tasks such as comment generation, code synthesis, and\nprogram repair. This suggests their strong potential to capture the logic\nbehind code modifications - an ability that is crucial for the task of comment\nupdating. Nevertheless, selecting an appropriate prompt strategy for an LLM on\neach update case remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel\ncomment updating framework, LLMCup, which first uses multiple prompt strategies\nto provide diverse candidate updated comments via an LLM, and then employs a\nranking model, CupRank, to select the best candidate as final updated comment.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMCup, with improvements\nover state-of-the-art baselines (CUP and HebCup) by 49.0%-116.9% in Accuracy,\n10.8%-20% in BLEU-4, 4.6% in METEOR, 0.9%-1.9% in F1, and 2.1%-3.4% in\nSentenceBert similarity.

However, when the system operates in dynamic\nenvironments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates\nwill inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts,\nwhich reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and\nlocal drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such,\nexisting offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to\nthese implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration\nperformance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online\nconfiguration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to\nthese drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the\nlocal and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper\nlevel, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the\nlocal model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the\nlower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and\nadapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA\ncombines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize\nredundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight\nsoftware systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA\nachieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with\nup to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to\nimprove different local models in handling concept drift."}

In this work,\nwe present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision\nconferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant\nagents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance\ndetection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and\nstance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,\nnegative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent\nsystem to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results\nindicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced\ndebates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also\nimprove the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and\ncoherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision\nconferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate\nthe potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group\ndecision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be\ninstrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops\nacross various domains."}

In tax consulting\npractice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime\ncandidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of\ntax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and\nwell-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a\nconsiderable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for\nenhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and\nreal-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the\nbest configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to\nsupport tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial\nanalyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to\nthe sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when\nproperly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and\nprovide legally grounded justifications for decisions.

Recently,\nthe field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and\nextracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep\nlearning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the\nquality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the\noperation of these models in publicly available argument classification\ndatabases.

This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.\ndeleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has\nprimarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts\nproduced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only\nhas more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)\nsystems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first\ncomprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker\nattribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker\nattribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well\nas how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that\nattribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and\nthat the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated\nwith attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker\nattribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not\nbetter, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR\ntranscription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker\nidentity."}

To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time\nKG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge\ngraph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion\nwithout any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard\nself-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward\naggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external\nknowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward\naggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations\nthrough KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying\nknowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles\nknowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds\nthem back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.\nBy synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports\nreal-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter\nmodification.
