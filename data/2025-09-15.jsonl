Existing AI for\nsoftware engineering leaderboards (e.g., SWE-bench) focus solely on solution\naccuracy, ignoring the crucial factor of effectiveness in a\nresource-constrained world. This is a universal problem that also exists beyond\nsoftware engineering tasks: any AI system should be more than correct - it must\nalso be cost-effective. To address this gap, we introduce SWE-Effi, a set of\nnew metrics to re-evaluate AI systems in terms of holistic effectiveness\nscores. We define effectiveness as the balance between the accuracy of outcome\n(e.g., issue resolve rate) and the resources consumed (e.g., token and time).\nIn this paper, we specifically focus on the software engineering scenario by\nre-ranking popular AI systems for issue resolution on a subset of the SWE-bench\nbenchmark using our new multi-dimensional metrics. We found that AI system's\neffectiveness depends not just on the scaffold itself, but on how well it\nintegrates with the base model, which is key to achieving strong performance in\na resource-efficient manner. We also identified systematic challenges such as\nthe \"token snowball\" effect and, more significantly, a pattern of \"expensive\nfailures\". In these cases, agents consume excessive resources while stuck on\nunsolvable tasks - an issue that not only limits practical deployment but also\ndrives up the cost of failed rollouts during RL training. Lastly, we observed a\nclear trade-off between effectiveness under the token budget and effectiveness\nunder the time budget, which plays a crucial role in managing project budgets\nand enabling scalable reinforcement learning, where fast responses are\nessential."}

However, existing LLM-based approaches\noften struggle with programs that include complex loop structures, leading to\nirrelevant specifications. Moreover, the rigorous proof obligations and design\nconstraints imposed by verification tools can further result in incomplete and\nambiguous specifications. To address these challenges, we propose SLD-Spec, an\nLLM-assisted specification generation method tailored for programs with complex\nloop constructs. SLD-Spec introduces two novel phases into the traditional\nspecification generation framework: (1) A slicing phase, which decomposes each\nfunction into code fragments containing independent loop structures, thereby\nreducing the complexity of specification generation; and (2) A logical deletion\nphase, which applies LLM-based reasoning to filter out incorrect candidate\nspecifications--especially those not easily identified by verification\ntool--while retaining valid ones. Experimental results show that on the simple\ndataset, SLD-Spec successfully verifies five more programs than the\nstate-of-the-art AutoSpec and reduces runtime by 23.73%. To address the\nlimitations of existing research, we manually construct a dataset comprising\nfour categories of complex loop programs. On this dataset, SLD-Spec\nsignificantly improves the correctness, relevance, and completeness of\ngenerated specifications compared to baseline methods, enabling 95.1% of\nassertions and 90.91% of programs to pass verification.

Targeting the\nefficiency bottlenecks of existing verified lifting systems, Stencil-Lifting\nachieves scalable stencil kernel abstraction through two key innovations.\nFirst, we propose a hierarchical recursive lifting theory that represents\nstencil kernels, structured as nested loops, using invariant subgraphs, which\nare customized data dependency graphs that capture loop-carried computation and\nstructural invariants. Each vertex in the invariant subgraph is associated with\na predicate-based summary, encoding its computational semantics. By enforcing\nself-consistency across these summaries, Stencil-Lifting ensures the derivation\nof correct loop invariants and postconditions for nested loops, eliminating the\nneed for external verification. Second, we develop a hierarchical recursive\nlifting algorithm that guarantees termination through a convergent recursive\nprocess, avoiding the inefficiencies of search-based synthesis. The algorithm\nefficiently derives the valid summaries of stencil kernels, and its\ncompleteness is formally proven. We evaluate Stencil-Lifting on diverse stencil\nbenchmarks from two different suites and on four real-world applications.\nExperimental results demonstrate that Stencil-Lifting achieves 31.62$\\times$\nand 5.8$\\times$ speedups compared to the state-of-the-art verified lifting\nsystems STNG and Dexter, respectively, while maintaining full semantic\nequivalence.

The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread\nadoption in development pipelines. Goal. We empirically assess the energy\nefficiency of Python code generated by LLMs against human-written code and code\ndeveloped by a Green software expert. Method. We test 363 solutions to 9 coding\nproblems from the EvoEval benchmark using 6 widespread LLMs with 4 prompting\ntechniques, and comparing them to human-developed solutions. Energy consumption\nis measured on three different hardware platforms: a server, a PC, and a\nRaspberry Pi for a total of ~881h (36.7 days). Results. Human solutions are 16%\nmore energy-efficient on the server and 3% on the Raspberry Pi, while LLMs\noutperform human developers by 25% on the PC. Prompting does not consistently\nlead to energy savings, where the most energy-efficient prompts vary by\nhardware platform. The code developed by a Green software expert is\nconsistently more energy-efficient by at least 17% to 30% against all LLMs on\nall hardware platforms. Conclusions. Even though LLMs exhibit relatively good\ncode generation capabilities, no LLM-generated code was more energy-efficient\nthan that of an experienced Green software developer, suggesting that as of\ntoday there is still a great need of human expertise for developing\nenergy-efficient Python code."}

Targeting the\nefficiency bottlenecks of existing verified lifting systems, Stencil-Lifting\nachieves scalable stencil kernel abstraction through two key innovations.\nFirst, we propose a hierarchical recursive lifting theory that represents\nstencil kernels, structured as nested loops, using invariant subgraphs, which\nare customized data dependency graphs that capture loop-carried computation and\nstructural invariants. Each vertex in the invariant subgraph is associated with\na predicate-based summary, encoding its computational semantics. By enforcing\nself-consistency across these summaries, Stencil-Lifting ensures the derivation\nof correct loop invariants and postconditions for nested loops, eliminating the\nneed for external verification. Second, we develop a hierarchical recursive\nlifting algorithm that guarantees termination through a convergent recursive\nprocess, avoiding the inefficiencies of search-based synthesis. The algorithm\nefficiently derives the valid summaries of stencil kernels, and its\ncompleteness is formally proven. We evaluate Stencil-Lifting on diverse stencil\nbenchmarks from two different suites and on four real-world applications.\nExperimental results demonstrate that Stencil-Lifting achieves 31.62$\\times$\nand 5.8$\\times$ speedups compared to the state-of-the-art verified lifting\nsystems STNG and Dexter, respectively, while maintaining full semantic\nequivalence.

Existing methods often lack the ability to provide\naccurate, real-time medical advice, particularly for irregular inputs and\nunderrepresented languages. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes\nan approach that fine-tunes large language models (LLMs) for Arabic medical\ntext generation. The system is designed to assist patients by providing\naccurate medical advice, diagnoses, drug recommendations, and treatment plans\nbased on user input. The research methodology required the collection of a\nunique dataset from social media platforms, capturing real-world medical\nconversations between patients and doctors. The dataset, which includes patient\ncomplaints together with medical advice, was properly cleaned and preprocessed\nto account for multiple Arabic dialects. Fine-tuning state-of-the-art\ngenerative models, such as Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, LLaMA-2-7B, and GPT-2\nMedium, optimized the system's ability to generate reliable medical text.\nResults from evaluations indicate that the fine-tuned Mistral-7B model\noutperformed the other models, achieving average BERT (Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers) Score values in precision, recall, and\nF1-scores of 68.5\\%, 69.08\\%, and 68.5\\%, respectively. Comparative\nbenchmarking and qualitative assessments validate the system's ability to\nproduce coherent and relevant medical replies to informal input. This study\nhighlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in\nadvancing HMS, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for global healthcare\nchallenges, especially in linguistically and culturally diverse environments."}

In this study, we propose a scalable synthetic\ndata augmentation strategy to expand the training corpus to 100,000 records.\nUsing advanced generative AI systems ChatGPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro we generated\n80,000 contextually relevant and medically coherent synthetic question-answer\npairs grounded in the structure of the original dataset. These synthetic\nsamples were semantically filtered, manually validated, and integrated into the\ntraining pipeline. We fine-tuned five LLMs, including Mistral-7B and AraGPT2,\nand evaluated their performance using BERTScore metrics and expert-driven\nqualitative assessments. To further analyze the effectiveness of synthetic\nsources, we conducted an ablation study comparing ChatGPT-4o and\nGemini-generated data independently.

Most existing LLM-based social\nsimulation studies focus primarily on designing agentic frameworks and\nsimulation environments, often overlooking the complexities of persona\ngeneration and the potential biases introduced by unrepresentative persona\nsets. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for synthesizing\nhigh-quality, population-aligned persona sets for LLM-driven social simulation.\nOur approach begins by leveraging LLMs to generate narrative personas from\nlong-term social media data, followed by rigorous quality assessment to filter\nout low-fidelity profiles. We then apply importance sampling to achieve global\nalignment with reference psychometric distributions, such as the Big Five\npersonality traits.

We examine this phenomenon of incongruent\npositivity as miscalibrated expressions of positive support in both human and\nLLM generated responses. To this end, we collected real user-assistant\ndialogues from Reddit across a range of emotional intensities and generated\nadditional responses using large language models for the same context. We\ncategorize these conversations by intensity into two levels: Mild, which covers\nrelationship tension and general advice, and Severe, which covers grief and\nanxiety conversations. This level of categorization enables a comparative\nanalysis of how supportive responses vary across lower and higher stakes\ncontexts. Our analysis reveals that LLMs are more prone to unrealistic\npositivity through dismissive and minimizing tone, particularly in high-stakes\ncontexts. To further study the underlying dimensions of this phenomenon, we\nfinetune LLMs on datasets with strong and weak emotional reactions. Moreover,\nwe developed a weakly supervised multilabel classifier ensemble (DeBERTa and\nMentalBERT) that shows improved detection of incongruent positivity types\nacross two sorts of concerns (Mild and Severe). Our findings shed light on the\nneed to move beyond merely generating generic positive responses and instead\nstudy the congruent support measures to balance positive affect with emotional\nacknowledgment.

However, though\nonly a few experts are activated for each token, SMoE still requires loading\nall expert parameters, leading to high memory usage and challenges in\ndeployment. Previous work has tried to reduce the overhead by pruning and\nmerging experts, but primarily focused on expert-level operations, leaving\nneuron-level structure underexplored. We propose DERN (Dropping Experts,\nRecombining Neurons), a task-agnostic and retraining-free framework for expert\npruning and reconstruction. We observe that experts are often misaligned and\ncontain semantic conflicts at the neuron level, which poses challenges for\ndirect merging. To solve this, DERN works in three steps: it first prunes\nredundant experts using router statistics; then it decomposes them into\nneuron-level expert segments, assigning each segment to its most compatible\nretained expert; and finally, it merges segments within each retained expert to\nbuild a compact representation. Experiments on Mixtral, Qwen, and DeepSeek SMoE\nmodels show that DERN improves performance by more than 5% on commonsense\nreasoning and MMLU benchmarks under 50% expert sparsity, without extra\ntraining. It also greatly reduces the number of experts and memory usage,\nmaking SMoE LLMs easier to deploy in practice."}

This has led to\nclaims about these model's ability to solve (learn) unseen tasks with only a\nfew shots (exemplars) in the prompt. However, deduction does not always imply\nlearning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the\nmodels rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue\nthat, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full\ncharacterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale\nanalysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining,\ndistributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that ICL is an\neffective learning paradigm, but limited in its ability to learn and generalise\nto unseen tasks. We note that, in the limit where exemplars become more\nnumerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt\nstyle, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from\nregularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity,\nespecially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought.
