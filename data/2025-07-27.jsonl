In recent years, the rise of\nlanguages with quantitative (e.g.~probabilistic) features has led to extensions\nof coinductive methods to more refined types of behavioural conformances, most\nnotably notions of behavioural distance. To guarantee soundness of coinductive\nreasoning, one needs to show that the behavioural conformance at hand forms a\nprogram congruence, i.e. it is suitably compatible with the operations of the\nlanguage. This is usually achieved by a complex proof technique known as\n\\emph{Howe's method}, which needs to be carefully adapted to both the specific\nlanguage and the targeted notion of behavioural conformance. We develop a\nuniform categorical approach to Howe's method that features two orthogonal\ndimensions of abstraction: (1) the underlying higher-order language is modelled\nby an \\emph{abstract higher-order specification} (AHOS), a novel and very\ngeneral categorical account of operational semantics, and (2) notions of\nbehavioural conformance (such as relations or metrics) are modelled via\nfibrations over the base category of an AHOS. Our main result is a fundamental\ncongruence theorem at this level of generality: Under natural conditions on the\ncategorical ingredients and the operational rules of a language modelled by an\nAHOS, the greatest behavioural (bi)conformance on its operational model forms a\ncongruence. We illustrate our theory by deriving congruence of bisimilarity and\nbehavioural pseudometrics for probabilistic higher-order languages."}

To address these\nlimitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that\noperates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks.

To simulate whole systems, multiple tools are usually needed\nto cover different parts. These parts include the hardware of a system and the\nenvironment with which the system interacts. The Functional Mock-up Interface\n(FMI) standard for co-simulation can be used to connect these tools.\n  The control part of modern systems is usually a computing unit, such as a\nSystem-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which executes software\nfrom a connected memory and interacts with peripherals. To develop software\nwithout requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the\nso-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used. The IEEE-standardized\nframework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and\nconcepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks\nnative FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation\nenvironments.\n  This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with\nSystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a\nsimulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature\nvalues from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified\ntarget software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data\nsuch as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus,\nextensive software testing and verification is enabled. By having tests ready\nand the software pre-tested using a VP once the physical hardware is available,\ncertifications like ISO 26262 can be done earlier."}

The effectiveness of\nICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which\nfocused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive\nperformances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality\nexamples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)\nDifficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and\nfeedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR\ndecouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval\nmodule to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task\ndataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise\nand guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve\nhigh-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP\ntasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across\nall datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, our approach\nis a plug-and-play method, which can be easily combined with various LLMs to\nimprove example retrieval abilities for ICL.

This paper introduces a novel\nframework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM)\nassistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a\nhierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into\nthree broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset\nthat reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and\nimplement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic\nspans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a\nglobal label. A secondary human verification study shows significant\nimprovements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we\nfine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation.\nInstead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality\nLLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a\nsmaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation.
