We analyzed 183 research papers published between\nJanuary 2020 and December 2024 to answer four key research questions (RQs). In\nRQ1, we examine the diverse failure data sources utilized, including advanced\nLLM-based processing techniques for legacy data and the incorporation of new\ndata sources enabled by LLMs. RQ2 explores the evolution of AIOps tasks,\nhighlighting the emergence of novel tasks and the publication trends across\nthese tasks.

In this paper we introduce\nfirst-class support for multidimensional arrays in dual-numbers reverse-mode AD\nwith little to no performance overhead. The algorithm consists of three\nloosely-coupled components: a semantics-preserving vectorisation code\ntransformation (the bulk-operation transform or BOT), a fairly straightforward\nlifting of the basic dual-numbers reverse AD algorithm to a mostly first-order\narray language, and symbolic interpretation to achieve an end-to-end\ncompilation pipeline. Unfortunately, we lose some of the nice generalisable\naspects of dual-numbers AD in the process, most importantly support for\nhigher-order code.\n  We do support some higher-order array combinators, but only a\ncarefully-chosen set: 'build' (elementwise array construction), 'gather' and\n'scatter'. In return, the BOT can eliminate the essential (for AD)\nhigher-orderness of the input program, meaning that AD gets essentially\npresented with a first-order program.

Language Model Representations Reflect Human Judgments of Event Plausibility", "comment": null, "summary": "Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question\nanswering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these\ntasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,\nwhether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely\nnonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human\nparticipants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by\ncorrelating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'\nratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM\nmodal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with\nthe potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans."}

External\nvalidation confirmed robustness (macro F1=0.966), outperforming conventional\nmachine learning, general-domain BERT models, and various decoder-only large\nlanguage models. NLP models, particularly fine-tuned clinical variants like\nBioClinicalBERT, offer a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose\ndeath classification from free-text reports.

In this work, we investigate whether the ability of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour depends on the particular humour\nform. We compare models on simple puns and more complex topical humour that\nrequires knowledge of real-world entities and events. In doing so, we curate a\ndataset of 600 jokes split across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality\nexplanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns,\ncontemporary internet humour, and topical jokes, where understanding relies on\nreasoning beyond \"common sense\", rooted instead in world knowledge regarding\nnews events and pop culture. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot\nabilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of\ndifferent types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour\nexplanation. We find that none of the tested models (inc. reasoning models) are\ncapable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further\nhighlighting the narrow focus of most works in computational humour on overly\nsimple joke forms."}

However, a\ncomprehensive understanding of the impact, potential, and limitations of LLMs\nin AIOps remains in its infancy. To address this gap, we conducted a detailed\nsurvey of LLM4AIOps, focusing on how LLMs can optimize processes and improve\noutcomes in this domain. We analyzed 183 research papers published between\nJanuary 2020 and December 2024 to answer four key research questions (RQs). In\nRQ1, we examine the diverse failure data sources utilized, including advanced\nLLM-based processing techniques for legacy data and the incorporation of new\ndata sources enabled by LLMs. RQ2 explores the evolution of AIOps tasks,\nhighlighting the emergence of novel tasks and the publication trends across\nthese tasks. RQ3 investigates the various LLM-based methods applied to address\nAIOps challenges. Finally, RQ4 reviews evaluation methodologies tailored to\nassess LLM-integrated AIOps approaches. Based on our findings, we discuss the\nstate-of-the-art advancements and trends, identify gaps in existing research,\nand propose promising directions for future exploration."}

Traditional Likert-scale\nmeasures often overlook the context-dependent and multifaceted nature of\nproject success. The proposed hierarchical Type-1 Mamdani fuzzy system\nprioritizes sustained positive impact for end-users, reducing emphasis on\nsecondary outcomes like stakeholder satisfaction and internal project success.\nThis dynamic approach may provide a more accurate measure of project success\nand could be adaptable to complex evaluations. Future research will focus on\nempirical testing and broader applications of fuzzy logic in social science."}
