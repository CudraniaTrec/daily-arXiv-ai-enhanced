These entail\nmethods and tools used for software development, such as build systems and\npipelines. To keep up with the rapid evolution of software, we need to bridge\nthe disconnect in methods and tools between software development and safety\nengineering today. We need to invest more in formality upfront - capturing\nsafety work products in semantically rich models that are machine-processable,\ndefining automatic consistency checks, and automating the generation of\ndocumentation - to benefit later.

In this work, we propose a novel approach to\nautomatically generate symbolic stubs for external functions during symbolic\nexecution that leverages Genetic Programming. When the symbolic executor\nencounters an external function, AutoStub generates training data by executing\nthe function on randomly generated inputs and collecting the outputs. Genetic\nProgramming then derives expressions that approximate the behavior of the\nfunction, serving as symbolic stubs. These automatically generated stubs allow\nthe symbolic executor to continue the analysis without manual intervention,\nenabling the exploration of program paths that were previously intractable.

Our goal is to effectively reuse this\ninference-time, expert-provided knowledge for future parses without retraining\nthe model. We present dynamic knowledge-augmented parsing(DKAP), where in\naddition to the input sentence, the model receives (dynamically growing) expert\nknowledge as a key-value lexicon that associates NL phrases with correct OVC\nconstructs. We propose ROLex, a retrieval-augmented parsing approach that uses\nthis lexicon. A retriever and a generator are trained to find and use the\nkey-value store to produce the correct parse. A key challenge lies in curating\ndata for this retrieval-augmented parser.

We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios:\n(1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard\nmedical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including\nover 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The\nresults demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation\nscenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain.\nMemorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and\ncan be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of\nclinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated\ndisclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g.,\nregeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these\nfindings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial\nmemorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy,\nminimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond\nsurface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the\nleakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information."}

While dependency trees combined with\ncontextual semantics effectively identify aspect sentiment, existing methods\nrelying on syntax trees and aspect-aware attention struggle to model complex\nsemantic relationships. Their dependence on linear dot-product features fails\nto capture nonlinear associations, allowing noisy similarity from irrelevant\nwords to obscure key opinion terms. Motivated by Differentiable Optimal\nMatching, we propose the Optimal Transport Enhanced Syntactic-Semantic Graph\nNetwork (OTESGN), which introduces a Syntactic-Semantic Collaborative\nAttention.

A Adaptive Attention Fusion module integrates\nthese heterogeneous features, and contrastive regularization further improves\nrobustness.

Prior work, primarily on GPT-style models, has\nidentified MLP modules in early layers as key contributors to factual recall.\nHowever, it remains unclear whether these findings generalize across different\nautoregressive architectures. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive\nevaluation of factual recall across several models -- including GPT, LLaMA,\nQwen, and DeepSeek -- analyzing where and how factual information is encoded\nand accessed. Consequently, we find that Qwen-based models behave differently\nfrom previous patterns: attention modules in the earliest layers contribute\nmore to factual recall than MLP modules.

However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the\nimplementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting\nstrategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic\nbiases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type\nI, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.\n  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks\nfrom 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.\nAnalyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure\nhow plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find\nincorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three\nhypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small\nlanguage models. While our findings show that higher task performance and\nbetter general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate\nmodels do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as\neffect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of\nfindings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking\nmitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in\nreducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly,\ncommon regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in\nreducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.\n  Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is\nunacceptably simple.
