However, these specifications can be\nviolated during compilation since they are erased after type checking. External\nprograms linked with the compiled program can violate the specifications of the\noriginal program and change the behavior of the compiled program -- even when\ncompiled with a verified compiler. For example, since Coq does not allow\nexplicitly allocating memory, a programmer might link their Coq program with a\nC program that can allocate memory. Even if the Coq program is compiled with a\nverified compiler, the external C program can still violate the memory-safe\nspecification of the Coq program by providing an uninitialized pointer to\nmemory. This error could be ruled out by type checking in a language expressive\nenough to indicate whether memory is initialized versus uninitialized. Linking\nwith a program with an uninitialized pointer could be considered ill-typed, and\nour linking process could prevent linking with ill-typed programs. To\nfacilitate type checking during linking, we can use type-preserving\ncompilation, which preserves the types through the compilation process.

MetaRAG operates in a real-time,\nunsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor\naccess to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes\ndomains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into\natomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using\nsynonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the\nretrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms\ncontradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a\nresponse-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG\nlocalizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g.,\npregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility),\nallowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure\nthresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a\nproprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for\ndetecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based\nconversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that\ntranslates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this\ndesign is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments."}

Existing methods either require expensive\ncomputational overhead or suffer from poor calibration, making them impractical\nand unreliable for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose GrACE, a\nGenerative Approach to Confidence Elicitation that enables scalable and\nreliable confidence elicitation for LLMs. GrACE adopts a novel mechanism in\nwhich the model expresses confidence by the similarity between the last hidden\nstate and the embedding of a special token appended to the vocabulary, in\nreal-time. We fine-tune the model for calibrating the confidence with\ncalibration targets associated with accuracy. Experiments with three LLMs and\ntwo benchmark datasets show that the confidence produced by GrACE achieves the\nbest discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks,\noutperforming six competing methods without resorting to additional sampling or\nan auxiliary model. Moreover, we propose two strategies for improving test-time\nscaling based on confidence induced by GrACE. Experimental results show that\nusing GrACE not only improves the accuracy of the final decision but also\nsignificantly reduces the number of required samples in the test-time scaling\nscheme, indicating the potential of GrACE as a practical solution for deploying\nLLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation."}

We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines\ndense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to\nimprove both semantic alignment and explainability.

In this paper, on mental\nmath tasks (i.e., direct math calculation via next-token prediction without\nexplicit reasoning), we investigate this question in three steps: inhibiting\ninput-specific token computations in the initial layers, restricting the routes\nof information transfer across token positions in the next few layers, and\nforcing all computation to happen at the last token in the remaining layers.\nWith two proposed techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and\nAttention-Based Peeking (ABP), we identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) with\nhigh accuracy on a wide variety of mental math tasks, where meaningful\ncomputation occurs very late (in terms of layer depth) and only at the last\ntoken, which receives information of other tokens in few specific middle\nlayers.
