High-level synthesis (HLS), as a pivotal solution,\nautomates hardware designs from high-level abstractions (e.g., C/C++). However,\nit faces significant challenges, particularly in design space exploration and\noptimization. While large language models (LLMs) have shown notable\ncapabilities in code generation, their application to HLS has been limited due\nto the scarcity of (publicly) available HLS code datasets. Hence, research in\nthis domain has primarily focused on techniques such as prompt engineering and\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To overcome this limitation, this paper\nintroduces SAGE-HLS, the first-of-its-kind fine-tuned LLM specifically for HLS\ncode generation. Our method includes three key advancements: (i) We implement\nVerilog-to-C/C++ porting, converting verified and synthesizable Verilog codes\ninto corresponding C, creating a dataset of 16.7K HLS codes; (ii) We implement\na fine-tuning strategy, which is based on instruction prompting to code\ngeneration guided by abstract syntax tree (AST); (iii) We develop a\nsemi-automated evaluation framework using VerilogEval to assess the\nfunctionality of the generated HLS code.

While hackathons\nhave long served as agile environments for rapid AI prototyping, few have\ndirectly addressed eXplainable AI (XAI) in real-world educational contexts.\nThis paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the XAI Challenge 2025, a\nhackathon-style competition jointly organized by Ho Chi Minh City University of\nTechnology (HCMUT) and the International Workshop on Trustworthiness and\nReliability in Neurosymbolic AI (TRNS-AI), held as part of the International\nJoint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025). The challenge tasked\nparticipants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering\nstudent queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based\nnatural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness,\nsolutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or\nhybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed\nvia logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student\nreview to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios. We describe the\nchallenge's motivation, structure, dataset construction, and evaluation\nprotocol. Situating the competition within the broader evolution of AI\nhackathons, we argue that it represents a novel effort to bridge LLMs and\nsymbolic reasoning in service of explainability. Our findings offer actionable\ninsights for future XAI-centered educational systems and competitive research\ninitiatives."}

Some linguists have embraced the view that Merge is an\nelementary, indivisible operation that emerged in a single evolutionary step.\nFrom a neurocognitive standpoint, different mental objects constructed by Merge\nmay be supported by distinct mechanisms: (1) simple command constructions\n(e.g., \"eat apples\"); (2) the merging of adjectives and nouns (\"red boat\"); and\n(3) the merging of nouns with spatial prepositions (\"laptop behind the sofa\").\nHere, we systematically investigate participants' comprehension of sentences\nwith increasing levels of syntactic complexity.

Comprehension of\npushdown automata is further complicated, because reasoning about the stack is\nnecessary. A common difficulty students face, for example, is understanding\nthat two different computations on the same word may reach the same state with\ndifferent stack values. To aid student understanding, we present two novel\ndynamic visualization tools for FSM -- a domain-specific programming language\nfor the Automata Theory classroom -- to support the design of such machines.\nThese tools visualize all computations that may be performed, respectively, by\na nondeterministic finite-state machine or by a pushdown automata in a stepwise\nmanner.

The Cache Manager stores the outputs of previously processed\nqueries and employs an adaptive strategy to reduce redundant computations and\nminimize response times. For queries not found in the cache, the Scheduler\ndynamically allocates them to the most suitable LLM based on the predicted\nperformance and cost from models that take both query-specific and LLM-specific\nfeatures as input.

The term \"Hierarchical\"\nreflects two key aspects of our system design: (1) a hierarchical moderation\npipeline, where a lightweight binary model first filters safe content and a\nstronger model handles fine-grained risk classification; and (2) a hierarchical\ntaxonomy in the second stage, where the model performs path-based\nclassification over a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from coarse to fine-grained\nlevels. To ensure alignment with evolving moderation policies, Hi-Guard\ndirectly incorporates rule definitions into the model prompt. To further\nenhance structured prediction and reasoning, we introduce a multi-level\nsoft-margin reward and optimize with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),\npenalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications and improving explanation\nquality. Extensive experiments and real-world deployment demonstrate that\nHi-Guard achieves superior classification accuracy, generalization, and\ninterpretability, paving the way toward scalable, transparent, and trustworthy\ncontent safety systems.

While prior research\nhas primarily focused on improving their training and inference strategies,\ntheir potential for in-context learning (ICL) remains largely underexplored. To\nfill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking),\na new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two\nreasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy.\nSpecifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel:\none in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of\nThinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent,\nusing a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both\ncandidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\\%\nin GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases,\nresulting in minimal latency overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple\nreasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms\nfew-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting with improved answer\nrobustness. Moreover, It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to\ntraining-based SOTA method, while substantially outperforming on\nout-of-distribution tasks.

To tackle this problem, we propose a novel\nframework, namely Misinformation detection with Dynamic Environmental\nRepresentations (MISDER).

However, a critical structural gap exists: user behavior\nsequences consist of discrete actions connected by semantically empty\nseparators, differing fundamentally from the coherent natural language in LM\npre-training. This mismatch causes semantic fragmentation, where LM attention\nscatters across irrelevant tokens instead of focusing on meaningful behavior\nboundaries and inter-behavior relationships, degrading prediction performance.\nTo address this, we propose $\\textit{CTR-Sink}$, a novel framework introducing\nbehavior-level attention sinks tailored for recommendation scenarios. Inspired\nby attention sink theory, it constructs attention focus sinks and dynamically\nregulates attention aggregation via external information. Specifically, we\ninsert sink tokens between consecutive behaviors, incorporating\nrecommendation-specific signals such as temporal distance to serve as stable\nattention sinks. To enhance generality, we design a two-stage training strategy\nthat explicitly guides LM attention toward sink tokens and a attention sink\nmechanism that amplifies inter-sink dependencies to better capture behavioral\ncorrelations. Experiments on one industrial dataset and two open-source\ndatasets (MovieLens, Kuairec), alongside visualization results, validate the\nmethod's effectiveness across scenarios."}

This, in turn, poses\nquestions about the fairness of these models in critical settings, which leads\nto the developement of different procedures to address bias in Natural Language\nProcessing. Although many datasets, metrics and algorithms have been proposed\nto measure and mitigate harmful prejudice in Natural Language Processing, their\nimplementation is diverse and far from centralized. As a response, this paper\npresents FairLangProc, a comprehensive Python package providing a common\nimplementation of some of the more recent advances in fairness in Natural\nLanguage Processing providing an interface compatible with the famous Hugging\nFace transformers library, aiming to encourage the widespread use and\ndemocratization of bias mitigation techniques.

Most evaluation\nframeworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer\nverification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules\nor evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current\nmethodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically\nevaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent\nstage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the\nrobustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across\ndifferent domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and\nrobust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It\ndemonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse\nreasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including\nmulti-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively\nidentifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark\ncomprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented\nthrough manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We\nanticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer\nverification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research.
