However, their\napplicability in proprietary industrial settings, where domain-specific\nconstraints and code interdependencies are prevalent, remains largely\nunexplored. We present a case study conducted in collaboration with the\nleveling department at ASML to investigate the performance of LLMs in\ngenerating functional, maintainable code within a closed, highly specialized\nsoftware environment.\n  We developed an evaluation framework tailored to ASML's proprietary codebase\nand introduced a new benchmark. Additionally, we proposed a new evaluation\nmetric, build@k, to assess whether LLM-generated code successfully compiles and\nintegrates within real industrial repositories. We investigate various\nprompting techniques, compare the performance of generic and code-specific\nLLMs, and examine the impact of model size on code generation capabilities,\nusing both match-based and execution-based metrics. The findings reveal that\nprompting techniques and model size have a significant impact on output\nquality, with few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting yielding the highest\nbuild success rates. The difference in performance between the code-specific\nLLMs and generic LLMs was less pronounced and varied substantially across\ndifferent model families."}

As High-Performance\nComputing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many\naccelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize\nlegacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance\nportability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos\nporting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs)\nhave shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully\nautonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains\nlargely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse\nhardware.\n  This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM \"agents\"\ncollaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize\nFortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline\nmodernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos\ncodes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and\no4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating\noptimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models\nlike Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes.\n  This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos\ntransformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy\nscientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse\nsupercomputers.

Our goal is to establish\nminimum-size compact LP formulations for problems in P having natural\nformulations with exponential extension complexities. Our broader vision is to\nenable the systematic generation of Compact Integer Programming (CIP)\nformulations for problems with exponential-size IPs having polynomial-time\nseparation oracles. To this end, we introduce a hierarchical linear pipelining\ntechnique that decomposes nested program structures into synchronized regions\nwith well-defined execution transitions -- functions of compile-time\nparameters.

In this work, we scale up environments as a step\ntowards advancing general agentic intelligence. This gives rise to two central\nchallenges: (i) how to scale environments in a principled manner, and (ii) how\nto effectively train agentic capabilities from experiences derived through\ninteractions with these environments. To address these, we design a scalable\nframework that automatically constructs heterogeneous environments that are\nfully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling\nscenarios. We further adapt a two-phase agent fine-tuning strategy: first\nendowing agents with fundamental agentic capabilities, then specializing them\nfor domain-specific contexts. Extensive experiments on agentic benchmarks,\ntau-bench, tau2-Bench, and ACEBench, demonstrate that our trained model,\nAgentScaler, significantly enhances the function-calling capability of models."}

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce WebWeaver, a novel dual-agent framework that emulates the human\nresearch process. The planner operates in a dynamic cycle, iteratively\ninterleaving evidence acquisition with outline optimization to produce a\ncomprehensive, source-grounded outline linking to a memory bank of evidence.\nThe writer then executes a hierarchical retrieval and writing process,\ncomposing the report section by section. By performing targeted retrieval of\nonly the necessary evidence from the memory bank for each part, it effectively\nmitigates long-context issues. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art\nacross major OEDR benchmarks, including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and\nDeepResearchGym. These results validate our human-centric, iterative\nmethodology, demonstrating that adaptive planning and focused synthesis are\ncrucial for producing high-quality, reliable, and well-structured reports."}

Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined\nrelationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly\nexhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this\nchallenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite\nexploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing\ninteraction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of\nprior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation,\nwe propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and\nadvantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned\nreasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three\nbenchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of\n4.5\\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\\% following ReSum-GRPO\ntraining. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a\nReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\\% Pass@1 on\nBrowseComp-zh and 18.3\\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web\nagents."}

This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and\noperates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually\nprovide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model,\nor do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate\npopular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that\nthey succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals,\nsuggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization\nmethods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations\noften reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated\nthem, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded. Taken\ntogether, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental\ncontrols to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful\ninsights into the operations of LLMs."}
