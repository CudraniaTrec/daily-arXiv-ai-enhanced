The deep learning models adopted in these studies demand significant computational resources for training and inference acceleration. This introduces high costs and undermines the cost-reduction goal of predictive mutation testing. (2) Constrained applicability. Although modern mutation testing tools generate mutants both inside and outside methods, current fine-grained predictive mutation testing approaches handle only inside-method mutants. As a result, they cannot predict outside-method mutants, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. We propose WITNESS, a new fine-grained predictive mutation testing approach. WITNESS adopts a twofold design: (1) With collected features from both inside-method and outside-method mutants, WITNESS is suitable for all generated mutants. (2) Instead of using computationally expensive deep learning, WITNESS employs lightweight classical machine learning models for training and prediction. This makes it more cost-effective and enabling straightforward explanations of the decision-making processes behind the adopted models. Evaluations on Defects4J projects show that WITNESS consistently achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance across different scenarios. Additionally, WITNESS significantly enhances the efficiency of kill matrix prediction. Post-hoc analysis reveals that features incorporating information from before and after the mutation are the most important among those used in WITNESS. Test case prioritization based on the predicted kill matrix shows that WITNESS delivers results much closer to those obtained by using the actual kill matrix, outperforming baseline approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faWITNESS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u53d6\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65b9\u6cd5\u5185\u5916\u53d8\u5f02\u4f53\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u53d8\u5f02\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u4e2d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u771f\u5b9e\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u52a0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u5f02\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u53d7\u9650\u4e24\u5927\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u8fdd\u80cc\u4e86\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u65b9\u6cd5\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u4f53\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5916\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u4f53\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aWITNESS\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u5f02\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002WITNESS\u6536\u96c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5185\u5916\u53d8\u5f02\u4f53\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u7c7b\u578b\u53d8\u5f02\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u4fbf\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Defects4J\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cWITNESS\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e1a\u754c\u9886\u5148\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86kill matrix\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u3002\u4e8b\u540e\u5206\u6790\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53d8\u5f02\u524d\u540e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4bkill matrix\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u65f6\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645kill matrix\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "WITNESS\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u5f02\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53d8\u5f02\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Over the past decades, a variety of refactoring approaches have been proposed, which can be broadly classified into metrics-based, rule-based, and machine learning-based approaches. Recent years, deep learning-based approaches have also attracted widespread attention. However, existing techniques exhibit various limitations. Metrics- and rule-based approaches rely heavily on manually defined heuristics and thresholds, whereas deep learning-based approaches are often constrained by dataset availability and model design. In this study, we proposed a graph-based deep learning approach for code smell refactoring. Specifically, we designed two types of input graphs (class-level and method-level) and employed both graph classification and node classification tasks to address the refactoring of three representative code smells: long method, large class, and feature envy. In our experiment, we propose a semi-automated dataset generation approach that could generate a large-scale dataset with minimal manual effort. We implemented the proposed approach with three classical GNN (graph neural network) architectures: GCN, GraphSAGE, and GAT, and evaluated its performance against both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches.

However, the widespread adoption of static analysis tools is hindered by their high false alarm rates. Previous studies have introduced the concept of actionable warnings and built a machine-learning method to distinguish actionable warnings from false alarms. However, according to our empirical observation, the current assumption used for actionable warning(s) collection is rather shaky and inaccurate, leading to a large number of invalid actionable warnings. To address this problem, in this study, we build the first large actionable warning dataset by mining 68,274 reversions from Top-500 GitHub C repositories, we then take one step further by assigning each actionable warning a weak label regarding its likelihood of being a real bug. Following that, we propose a two-stage framework called ACWRecommender to automatically recommend the actionable warnings with high probability to be real bugs (AWHB). Our approach warms up the pre-trained model UniXcoder by identifying actionable warnings task (coarse-grained detection stage) and rerank AWHB to the top by weakly supervised learning (fine-grained reranking stage). Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms several baselines by a large margin in terms of nDCG and MRR for AWHB recommendation. Moreover, we ran our tool on 6 randomly selected projects and manually checked the top-ranked warnings from 2,197 reported warnings, we reported top-10 recommended warnings to developers, 27 of them were already confirmed by developers as real bugs.

New laws and regulations come into effect regularly and laws and regulations, as well as their interpretations, are subjected to constant revision. In addition, computational reasoning with laws requires a cross-disciplinary process involving both legal and software expertise.\n  This paper reflects on the domain-specific software language eFLINT developed to experiment with novel solutions. The language combines declarative and procedural elements to reason about situations and scenarios respectively, explicates and formalises connections between legal concepts and computational concepts, and is designed to automate compliance checks both before, during and after a software system runs. The various goals and applications areas for the language give rise to (conflicting) requirements. This paper reflects on the current design of the language by recalling various applications, the requirements they imposed, and subsequent design decisions. As such, this paper reports on results and insights of an investigation that can benefit language developers within the field of automated compliance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86eFLINT\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5408\u89c4\u68c0\u67e5\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u6709\u76ca\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u3001\u6cd5\u89c4\u548c\u5408\u540c\u7684\u5408\u89c4\u68c0\u67e5\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u957f\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u670d\u52a1\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u591a\u76f8\u5173\u6cd5\u89c4\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5408\u89c4\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5408\u89c4\u68c0\u67e5\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u4f46\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u3001\u6cd5\u89c4\u7684\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u53cd\u601d\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5408\u89c4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6240\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8bed\u8a00eFLINT\u3002\u8be5\u8bed\u8a00\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u4e0e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5f0f\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u5e94\u9759\u6001\u60c5\u51b5\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u660e\u786e\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c\u524d\u3001\u4e2d\u3001\u540e\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u67e5\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u5e94\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\u3001\u9700\u6c42\u53ca\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "eFLINT\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u591f\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u6ee1\u8db3\u5404\u79cd\uff08\u751a\u81f3\u76f8\u4e92\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\uff09\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86eFLINT\u5e94\u7528\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u6d1e\u89c1\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f71\u54cd\u8bed\u8a00\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90fd\u4e3a\u540c\u884c\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5408\u89c4\u76f8\u5173\u8bed\u8a00\u5e26\u6765\u501f\u9274\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "eFLINT\u8bed\u8a00\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5408\u89c4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5176\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5408\u89c4\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5177\u6709\u53c2\u8003\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The tension between these two mindsets makes modular programming error prone. Functions that encapsulate collective operations, despite being called per-thread, must be executed cooperatively by groups of threads.\n  In this work, we introduce Prism, a new GPU language that restores modularity while still giving programmers the low-level control over collective operations necessary for high performance. Our core idea is typed perspectives, which materialize, at the type level, the granularity at which the programmer is controlling the behavior of threads. We describe the design of Prism, implement a compiler for it, and lay its theoretical foundations in a core calculus called Bundl. We implement state-of-the-art GPU kernels in Prism and find that it offers programmers the safety guarantees needed to confidently write modular code without sacrificing performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GPU\u8bed\u8a00Prism\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u578b\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u96c6\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0e\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e2\u53ef\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u53c8\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u6027\u80fd\u7684GPU\u7f16\u7a0b\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3GPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5cf0\u503c\u6027\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u517c\u987e\u5355\u7ebf\u7a0b\u884c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u534f\u4f5c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u4f7f\u5f97\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7f16\u7a0b\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6a21\u5757\u5316\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u8ba9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u4f4e\u5c42\u6b21\u63a7\u5236\u96c6\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Prism\u8fd9\u95e8\u65b0GPU\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u8be5\u8bed\u8a00\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u578b\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5728\u7c7b\u578b\u5c42\u9762\u4e0a\u660e\u786e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u63a7\u5236\u7ebf\u7a0b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u3002\u5305\u62ecPrism\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee5\u53ca\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff08Bundl\u6838\u5fc3\u6f14\u7b97\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u73b0\u5148\u8fdb\u7684GPU\u5185\u6838\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "Prism\u80fd\u4e3a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4fe1\u5730\u7f16\u5199\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5176\u5b9e\u6d4b\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u96c6\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u4f4e\u5c42\u6b21\u9ad8\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Prism\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86GPU\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u96c6\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5f00\u53d1\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We introduce TimeStampEval, a benchmark for retrieving precise millisecond timestamps from long transcripts given non-verbatim quotes. Our simple two-stage method dramatically improves retrieval accuracy while cutting inference costs by over 90%. The motivating use case is an automated long-form podcast that assembles Congressional Record clips into AI-hosted narration. The technical challenge: given a sentence-timestamped transcript and a target quote that may differ due to transcription or editorial drift, return exact start and end boundaries. Standard algorithms handle verbatim text but break under fuzzier variants. Evaluating six modern LLMs on a 2,800-sentence (120k-token) transcript revealed four key findings. (1) Prompt design matters more than model choice: placing the query before the transcript and using compact formatting improved accuracy by 3-20 points while reducing token count by 30-40%. (2) Off-by-one errors form a distinct category, showing models understand the task but misplace boundaries. (3) A modest reasoning budget (600-850 tokens) raises accuracy from 37% to 77% for weak setups and to above 90% for strong ones. (4) Our \"Assisted Fuzzy\" approach-RapidFuzz pre-filtering followed by LLM verification on short snippets-improves fuzzy match accuracy by up to 50 points while halving latency and reducing cost per correct result by up to 96%.

Sample consensus techniques - such as majority voting or validation against generated tests or specifications - aim to identify a correct program in the sample or abstain if none is valid. However, existing methods often fail to select a correct solution when its sampling probability is low, or when the problem permits multiple valid but non-equivalent solutions. Additionally, they often fail to abstain when no correct solution is present in the sample. To overcome these limitations, we introduce semantic triangulation, which transforms a programming problem in a way that non-trivially alters its semantics while preserving an exact, verifiable mapping between solutions before and after transformation. We theoretically establish that verifying consistency across such problem transformations increases confidence that generated programs reflect accurate generalization rather than spurious statistical correlations, enabling more reliable sample consensus and abstention. On the LiveCodeBench and CodeElo benchmarks, using GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 models, semantic triangulation increases reliability of generated code by 21% compared to the method that selects only high-confidence solutions with the probability threshold 0.5, while being able to pinpoint correct solutions at sampling probabilities as low as 0.14.

Efficient solutions to this problem are critical, since the executable specifications used by PBT often have preconditions that input values must satisfy in order to be valid test cases, and satisfying values are often sparsely distributed.\n  We propose a novel approach to this problem using ideas from deductive program synthesis. We present a set of synthesis rules, based on a denotational semantics of generators, that give rise to an automatic procedure for synthesizing correct generators. Our system handles recursive predicates by rewriting them as catamorphisms and then matching with appropriate anamorphisms; this is theoretically simpler than other approaches to synthesis for recursive functions, yet still extremely expressive.\n  Our implementation, Palamedes, is an extensible library for the Lean theorem prover. The synthesis algorithm itself is built on standard proof-search tactics, reducing implementation burden and allowing the algorithm to benefit from further advances in Lean proof automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8d28\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u548c\u9012\u5f52\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Lean\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5408\u6210\u7cfb\u7edfPalamedes\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ea6\u675f\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u5728\u6027\u8d28\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6781\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u8c13\u8bcd\u7684\u503c\u5206\u5e03\u7a00\u758f\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u503c\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u5982PBT\uff09\u7684\u6548\u679c\u975e\u5e38\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u6307\u79f0\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u5957\u5408\u6210\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528Lean\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u80fd\u591f\u6b63\u786e\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u503c\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002\u9012\u5f52\u8c13\u8bcd\u91c7\u7528\u6d88\u9012\u5f52\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5c06\u8c13\u8bcd\u91cd\u5199\u4e3a\u6d88\u9012\u5f52\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u751f\u9012\u5f52\u5339\u914d\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7b80\u6d01\u4e14\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u5f3a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u81ea\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86Palamedes\u5e93\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u6613\u96c6\u6210\u81f3Lean\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc1\u660e\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6539\u5584\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u8f93\u5165\u503c\u7684\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6027\u8d28\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u601d\u60f3\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u7ea6\u675f\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Lean\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edfPalamedes\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u6307\u5b9a\u8c13\u8bcd\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002"}}

Extended version of the paper accepted to VMCAI 2026, containing appendix", "summary": "Cellular automata (CA) are well-studied models of decentralized parallel computation, known for their ability to exhibit complex global behavior from simple local rules. While their dynamics have been widely explored through simulations, a formal treatment of CA as genuine language generators remains underdeveloped. We formalize CA-expressible languages as sets of finite words obtained by projecting the non-quiescent segments of configurations reachable by one-dimensional, deterministic, synchronous CA over bi-infinite grids. These languages are defined with respect to sets of initial configurations specified by a regular language as in regular model checking. To capture structured dynamics, we propose a glider-based generative semantics for CA. Inspired by the classical notion of gliders, we define a glider as a one-cell entity carrying a symbol in a certain velocity under well defined interaction semantics. We show that despite the regularity of the initial configurations and the locality of the transition rules, the resulting languages can exhibit non-regular and even non-context-free structure. This positions regular-initialized CA languages as a surprisingly rich computational model, with potential applications in the formal analysis of linearly ordered MAS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5c06\u7ec6\u80de\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86glider\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u8d85\u8d8a\u6b63\u89c4\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65e0\u5173\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ec6\u80de\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff08CA\uff09\u4ee5\u5176\u7b80\u5355\u5c40\u90e8\u89c4\u5219\u4e0b\u80fd\u591f\u5c55\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u5168\u5c40\u884c\u4e3a\u800c\u8457\u79f0\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6210\u719f\u3002\u6b64\u6b21\u5de5\u4f5c\u6b63\u662f\u4e3a\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u7531\u4e00\u7ef4\u3001\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u7ec6\u80de\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff08\u5728bi-infinite\u6805\u683c\u4e0a\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff09\u53ef\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u89c4\u5219\u8bed\u8a00\u5b9a\u4e49\u521d\u59cb\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6295\u5f71\u5206\u6790\u8fbe\u5230\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u9759\u6b62\u6bb5\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5f97\u5230\u6709\u9650\u5355\u8bcd\u96c6\u5408\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eglider\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\uff0cglider\u88ab\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u643a\u5e26\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u4e00\u5143\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u62e5\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u914d\u7f6e\u5177\u6709\u89c4\u5219\u6027\u3001\u8f6c\u6362\u89c4\u5219\u5c40\u90e8\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u4ee5\u8d85\u8d8a\u6b63\u89c4\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65e0\u5173\u8bed\u8a00\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u8fdc\u5f3a\u4e8e\u4ee5\u5f80\u8ba4\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ecf\u89c4\u5219\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u7ec6\u80de\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u7c7b\u6781\u5176\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5206\u6790\u6709\u5e8f\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MAS\uff09\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Unlike previous agents that only scale up model size or context length, MiroThinker explores interaction scaling at the model level, systematically training the model to handle deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions as a third dimension of performance improvement. Unlike LLM test-time scaling, which operates in isolation and risks degradation with longer reasoning chains, interactive scaling leverages environment feedback and external information acquisition to correct errors and refine trajectories. Through reinforcement learning, the model achieves efficient interaction scaling: with a 256K context window, it can perform up to 600 tool calls per task, enabling sustained multi-turn reasoning and complex real-world research workflows. Across four representative benchmarks-GAIA, HLE, BrowseComp, and BrowseComp-ZH-the 72B variant achieves up to 81.9%, 37.7%, 47.1%, and 55.6% accuracy respectively, surpassing previous open-source agents and approaching commercial counterparts such as GPT-5-high. Our analysis reveals that MiroThinker benefits from interactive scaling consistently: research performance improves predictably as the model engages in deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions, demonstrating that interaction depth exhibits scaling behaviors analogous to model size and context length. These findings establish interaction scaling as a third critical dimension for building next-generation open research agents, complementing model capacity and context windows.", "AI": {"tldr": "MiroThinker v1.0\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f00\u6e90\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5546\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u4ea4\u4e92\u6269\u5c55\u88ab\u8bc1\u5b9e\u662f\u63a8\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u6b65\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6216\u589e\u52a0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u957f\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86MiroThinker v1.0\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5728256K\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u8fbe600\u6b21\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u73af\u5883\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u77eb\u6b63\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9009\u7528GAIA\u3001HLE\u3001BrowseComp\u548cBrowseComp-ZH\u7b49\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "MiroThinker 72B\u5728\u56db\u5927\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8681.9%\u300137.7%\u300147.1%\u300155.6%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e14\u63a5\u8fd1GPT-5-high\u7b49\u5546\u7528\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6269\u5c55\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u957f\u671f\u3001\u591a\u8f6e\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ea4\u4e92\u6269\u5c55\uff08interaction scaling\uff09\u88ab\u786e\u7acb\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u653e\u7814\u7a76\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u4e92\u4e3a\u8865\u5145\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u7814\u7a76\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Runtime testing is inherently unreliable - limited input coverage and reward hacking can mask incorrect behavior - while manual formal verification is reliable but cannot scale to match LLM output rates, creating a critical validation bottleneck.\n  We present ProofWright, an agentic verification framework that bridges this gap by integrating automated formal verification with LLM-based code generation. ProofWright provides end-to-end guarantees of memory safety, thread safety, and semantic correctness for LLM-generated CUDA kernels. On KernelBench L1, ProofWright verifies safety properties for 74% of generated kernels, uncovers subtle correctness errors missed by conventional testing, and establishes semantic equivalence for a class of element-wise kernels. With a modest overhead of 3 minutes per kernel, ProofWright demonstrates that scalable, automated formal verification of LLM-generated GPU code is feasible - offering a path toward trustworthy high-performance code generation without sacrificing developer productivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210GPU\u4ee3\u7801\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6ProofWright\u3002\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4ee3\u7801\u53ef\u4fe1\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136LLM\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210CUDA\u5185\u6838\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e38\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u96be\u4ee5\u5bdf\u89c9\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5339\u914d\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5b58\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0eLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aagent\u5316\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7684CUDA\u5185\u6838\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u3002", "result": "\u5728KernelBench L1\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0b\uff0cProofWright\u5bf974%\u7684\u5185\u6838\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5e38\u89c4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9057\u6f0f\u7684\u5fae\u5999\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5185\u6838\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5185\u6838\u5e73\u5747\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8017\u65f6\u4ec53\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ProofWright\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684CUDA\u5185\u6838\u4ee3\u7801\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u7ebf\u7a0b\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u4fdd\u969c\u3002"}}

Controlled SANs systematically capture dynamic behavior involving nondeterminism, probabilistic branching, and stochastic timing, while enabling policy-driven decision-making within a rigorous mathematical framework.\n  We develop a hierarchical, automata-theoretic semantics for Controlled SANs that encompasses nondeterministic, probabilistic, and stochastic models in a uniform manner. A structured taxonomy of control policies, ranging from memoryless and finite-memory strategies to computationally augmented policies, is formalized, and their expressive power is characterized through associated language classes. To support model abstraction and compositional reasoning, we introduce behavioral equivalences, including bisimulation and stochastic isomorphism.\n  Controlled SANs generalize classical frameworks such as continuous-time Markov decision processes (CTMDPs), providing a rigorous foundation for the specification, verification, and synthesis of dependable systems operating under uncertainty. This framework enables both quantitative and qualitative analysis, advancing the design of safety-critical systems where control, timing, and stochasticity are tightly coupled.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u53ef\u63a7\u968f\u673a\u6d3b\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\uff08Controlled SANs\uff09\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u968f\u673a\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u3001\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b9e\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b9e\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u5982\u968f\u673a\u6027\u548c\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u4e0e\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u63cf\u8ff0\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u201c\u53ef\u63a7\u968f\u673a\u6d3b\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u201d\uff08Controlled SANs\uff09\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u63a7\u5236\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u6982\u7387\u5206\u652f\u548c\u968f\u673a\u8ba1\u65f6\u7eb3\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u8bba\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u7c7b\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7b49\u4ef7\uff08\u5982\u4e92\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u968f\u673a\u540c\u6784\uff09\u3002", "result": "Controlled SANs\u80fd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6db5\u76d6\u548c\u63a8\u5e7f\u4f20\u7edf\u5982CTMDP\u7b49\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u62bd\u8c61\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "Controlled SANs\u4e3a\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u3001\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u7efc\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u8ba1\u65f6\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u591a\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

It scales to model sizes and model types that are out of reach for exhaustive, analytical techniques. So far, it has been used to evaluate one property value at a time only. Many practical problems, however, require finding the Pareto front of optimal tradeoffs between multiple possibly conflicting optimisation objectives. In this paper, we present the first statistical model checking approach for such multi-objective Pareto queries, using lightweight strategy sampling to optimise over the model's nondeterministic choices. We first introduce an incremental scheme that almost surely converges to a statistically sound confidence band bounding the true Pareto front from both sides in the long run. To obtain a close underapproximation of the true front in finite time, we then propose three heuristic approaches that try to make the best of an a-priori fixed sampling budget. We implement our new techniques in the Modest Toolset's 'modes' simulator, and experimentally show their effectiveness on quantitative verification benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u53ea\u652f\u6301\u5355\u4e00\u5c5e\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u903c\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9ePareto\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5355\u4e00\u5c5e\u6027\u503c\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u8bb8\u591a\u95ee\u9898\u9700\u8981\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u95f4\u5bfb\u6c42\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u8861\uff08Pareto\u524d\u6cbf\uff09\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1a\u4e0d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u76ee\u6807Pareto\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u91c7\u6837\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u9009\u62e9\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5305\u542b\u9012\u589e\u5f0f\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u6536\u655b\u4e8e\u53ef\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u5305\u56f4\u771f\u5b9ePareto\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e09\u79cd\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6709\u9650\u91c7\u6837\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8eModest Toolset\u5de5\u5177\u7684'modes'\u4eff\u771f\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u76ee\u6807Pareto\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We assess definitions of reasoning and how key papers in the field of natural language processing (NLP) use the notion and argue that the definitions provided are not consistent with how LMs are trained, process information, and generate new tokens. To illustrate this incommensurability we assume the view that transformer-based LMs implement an \\textit{implicit} finite-order Markov kernel mapping contexts to conditional token distributions. In this view, reasoning-like outputs correspond to statistical regularities and approximate statistical invariances in the learned kernel rather than the implementation of explicit logical mechanisms. This view is illustrative of the claim that LMs are \"statistical pattern matchers\"\" and not genuine reasoners and provides a perspective that clarifies why reasoning-like outputs arise in LMs without any guarantees of logical consistency. This distinction is fundamental to how epistemic uncertainty is evaluated in LMs. We invite a discussion on the importance of how the computational processes of the systems we build and analyze in NLP research are described.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u8f93\u51fa\u5176\u5b9e\u662f\u7edf\u8ba1\u89c4\u5f8b\u5339\u914d\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u62e5\u6709\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e94\u8c28\u614e\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u91cd\u89c6\u6a21\u578b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u9886\u57df\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u201c\u63a8\u7406\u201d\u7a76\u7adf\u610f\u5473\u7740\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u5173\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b9a\u4e49\u662f\u5426\u771f\u7684\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u68b3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u5173\u952e\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5047\u8bbe\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89c6\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9690\u5f0f\u6709\u9650\u9636\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6838\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6620\u5c04\u81f3\u6761\u4ef6token\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u8fdb\u800c\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u201c\u63a8\u7406\u201d\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u89c4\u5f8b\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u50cf\u662f\u201c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u5668\u201d\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5177\u5907\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e3a\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f93\u51fa\u5e76\u4e0d\u4fdd\u8bc1\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u5f3a\u8c03\u5e94\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0e\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8868\u8ff0\u4e0e\u5176\u771f\u5b9e\u5e95\u5c42\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u679c\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u89c4\u5f8b\u5339\u914d\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u9700\u5728NLP\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u66f4\u52a0\u5173\u6ce8\u548c\u6f84\u6e05\u6b64\u7c7b\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9645\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u63cf\u7ed8\u3002"}}

Although many programming languages and frameworks exist, engineers still lack sufficient empirical evidence to guide the choice of tools for advanced industrial applications. This study addresses that need by measuring and comparing worst-case execution time (WCET) and development time across six languages and frameworks: C++, Java, Jade, Jason, and fuzzy Jason BDI with both loosely and tightly coupled integration. These technologies reflect a progression from procedural and object-oriented programming to agent-based frameworks capable of symbolic and fuzzy reasoning.\n  Rather than relying on broad concepts such as paradigms or orientations, the study adopts a developer-centred approach grounded in measurable outcomes. The structured comparison examines how rising abstraction levels and reasoning capabilities affect both development effort and runtime behaviour. By analysing these dimensions, the study highlights concrete trade-offs between engineering workload and execution efficiency.\n  The findings show how abstraction and reasoning mechanisms shape system performance and developer productivity, offering practical insight for designing intelligent, agent-based solutions that must operate under real-time constraints and complex decision-making requirements. Overall, the study contributes evidence-based guidance for selecting software technologies in industrial informatization, supporting improved integration efficiency, maintainability, and responsiveness, and laying groundwork for future research on the interplay between language features, development dynamics, and runtime behaviour in cyber-physical and smart manufacturing systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u516d\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u96c6\u6210\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5de5\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5408\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u5177\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u5f00\u53d1\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u4ee5\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u516d\u79cd\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6846\u67b6\uff08C++\u3001Java\u3001Jade\u3001Jason\u3001\u542b\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u7684Jason BDI\uff09\u5728\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff08WCET\uff09\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5f0f\u3001\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5206\u6790\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u7ea7\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u6295\u5165\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u548c\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u5236\u9020\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6280\u672f\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u6210\u6548\u7387\u3001\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u6027\u3001\u5f00\u53d1\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Based on this formulation, we develop a unified framework that unifies LLM-based generation with syntactic and semantic validation and a quantitative cost-guided feedback mechanism.

While LLMs show promise in generating structured outputs from natural language (NL), such as Gherkin Scenarios from NL feature requirements, there's currently no formal method to verify if these outputs are accurate. This paper takes a preliminary step toward addressing this gap by exploring the use of a simple LLM-based autoformalizer to verify LLM-generated outputs against a small set of natural language requirements. We conducted two distinct experiments. In the first one, the autoformalizer successfully identified that two differently-worded NL requirements were logically equivalent, demonstrating the pipeline's potential for consistency checks. In the second, the autoformalizer was used to identify a logical inconsistency between a given NL requirement and an LLM-generated output, highlighting its utility as a formal verification tool. Our findings, while limited, suggest that autoformalization holds significant potential for ensuring the fidelity and logical consistency of LLM-generated outputs, laying a crucial foundation for future, more extensive studies into this novel application.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u521d\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7684autoformalizer\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9700\u6c42\u548cLLM\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5177\u6709\u53d1\u73b0\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e0e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u903b\u8f91\uff08autoformalization\uff09\u53d8\u5f97\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9a8c\u8bc1LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b63\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5224\u65adLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u9700\u6c42\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355LLM\u7684autoformalizer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9700\u6c42\u4e0eLLM\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u8ff0\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u4e0a\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u68c0\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cautoformalizer\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u8ff0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9700\u6c42\u4e0eLLM\u8f93\u51fa\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86autoformalizer\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u89c4\u6a21\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46autoformalization\u5728\u63d0\u5347LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The analysis shows that using a logic paradigm is an efficient way to attack complex graph problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u903b\u8f91\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c4\u7f16\u7a0b\u89e3\u51b3\u5b50\u56fe\u540c\u6784\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u903b\u8f91\u7f16\u7a0b\u5982Prolog\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u65f6\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u7f16\u7a0b\uff08\u5982Prolog\uff09\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u7f16\u7a0b\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0b\u89e3\u51b3\u5b50\u56fe\u540c\u6784\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8f83\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u56fe\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aProlog\u903b\u8f91\u8bed\u53e5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5e76\u884c\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u968f\u56fe\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u903b\u8f91\u7f16\u7a0b\u8303\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9488\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u7f16\u7a0b\uff08\u4f8b\u5982Prolog\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u56fe\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

We evaluated seven open-weight models (0.6B-70B parameters) on hydropower licensing documentation to provide empirical deployment guidance.\n  Our analysis identified a pronounced 14B parameter threshold where validation methods transition from ineffective (F1 $<$ 0.15) to viable (F1 = 0.64). Consumer-deployable models achieve 64\\% F1 through appropriate validation, while smaller models plateau at 51\\%. Large-scale models approach 77\\% F1 but require enterprise infrastructure.\n  We identified systematic hallucination patterns where perfect recall indicates extraction failure rather than success in smaller models. Our findings establish the first comprehensive resource-performance mapping for open-weight information extraction in regulatory contexts, enabling evidence-based model selection.\n  These results provide immediate value for hydropower compliance while contributing insights into parameter scaling effects that generalize across information extraction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u6c34\u529b\u53d1\u7535\u5408\u89c4\u6587\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\u62bd\u53d6\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u8fbe\u523014B\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u624d\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u6613\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u4f18\u79c0\u4f46\u8d44\u6e90\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u62bd\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u76d1\u7ba1\u6587\u4ef6\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u606f\u62bd\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e4b\u95f4\u6743\u8861\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6c34\u529b\u53d1\u7535\u8bb8\u53ef\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u6863\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e867\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u57280.6B\u523070B\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6c34\u529b\u53d1\u7535\u8bb8\u53ef\u6587\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u606f\u62bd\u53d6\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u53ca\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u91cd\u70b9\u8003\u5bdf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793aF1\u503c\u968f\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u8fbe\u523014B\u65f6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u624d\u7531\u65e0\u6548\uff08F1<0.15\uff09\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u53ef\u884c\uff08F1=0.64\uff09\u3002\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u8fbe64% F1\uff0c\u800c\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4ec5\u4e3a51%\u3002\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u53ef\u8fbe77% F1\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u7b97\u529b\u3002\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5e7b\u89c9\uff08hallucination\uff09\u2014\u2014\u56de\u5fc6\u7387\u8fc7\u9ad8\u53cd\u800c\u4e3a\u62bd\u53d6\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u6807\u5fd7\u3002\u9996\u6b21\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76d1\u7ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u62bd\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76d1\u7ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u62bd\u53d6\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u80fd-\u8d44\u6e90\u5bf9\u7167\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u65e2\u63a8\u52a8\u6c34\u529b\u53d1\u7535\u5408\u89c4\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u6269\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}
