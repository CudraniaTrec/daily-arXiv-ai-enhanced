TL;DR: 本文研究了用连续计数器对系统进行建模，相较于离散计数器，不仅简化了复杂性，还保证了重要性质（如可达性）的可判定性，并能有效构造对应有限自动机，尽管自动机规模可能很大。

Motivation: 离散计数器广泛用于并发程序等系统的建模，但容易导致高复杂性。为了改善分析效率，引入连续计数器作为离散计数器的高效过近似。

Method: 将离散计数器放宽为连续计数器（取值为非负有理数），对系统进行建模与分析，证明这些模型在可达性等问题上保持可判定性，同时给出有限自动机构造方法并分析其规模下界。

Result: 连续计数器系统的可达语言是正则的，可有效构造有限自动机，但自动机的规模存在非初等下界。

Conclusion: 尽管连续计数器是无限状态的，但能够到达目标配置的计数器指令序列的语言是正则的，并且可以有效构建对应的有限自动机。

Abstract: Counters that hold natural numbers are ubiquitous in modeling and verifying software systems; for example, they model dynamic creation and use of resources in concurrent programs. Unfortunately, such discrete counters often lead to extremely high complexity. Continuous counters are an efficient over-approximation of discrete counters. They are obtained by relaxing the original counters to hold values over the non-negative rational numbers.
  This work shows that continuous counters are extraordinarily well-behaved in terms of decidability. Our main result is that, despite continuous counters being infinite-state, the language of sequences of counter instructions that can arrive in a given target configuration, is regular. Moreover, a finite automaton for this language can be computed effectively. This implies that a wide variety of transition systems can be equipped with continuous counters, while maintaining decidability of reachability properties. Examples include higher-order recursion schemes, well-structured transition systems, and decidable extensions of discrete counter systems.
  We also prove a non-elementary lower bound for the size of the resulting finite automaton.
