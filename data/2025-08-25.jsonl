To build such a\ncontext-sensitive parser, we propose a framework of a dynamic tree of parsers\n(ToP) during parsing, where each parser corresponds to a modular context-free\ngrammar enriched with contextual information such as variable scopes and type\nconstraints, with tree branches representing ambiguity in the future code\nsegment. We demonstrate our approach through sLua, a strongly typed variant of\nLua, showing that our method can generate semantically correct programs\nconforming to any prescribed scripting API. We further show that, with careful\ndesign, our semantic guarantees extend to runtime correctness, as validated in\nthe application of generating game mechanics for a roguelike video game."}

Downstream metrics are usually employed to evaluate the\npractical utility of a model, but can be unreliable and require complex\ncalculations and domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, intrinsic metrics such\nas perplexity, entropy, and mutual information, which measure model confidence\nor uncertainty, are simple, versatile, and universal across LLMs and tasks, and\ncan serve as proxies for functional correctness and hallucination risk in\nLLM-generated code.

This work examines how\npersuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed\noutputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based\nmodels can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,\npromoting misinformation or biased narratives.\n  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate\nrealistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their\nbeliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.\nPersuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief\ndistributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and\namplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are\nfurther probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with\nadditional models.\n  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt\ntone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing,\nand legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate\nmisinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing\nstereotypes and widening inequities.

On the basis of a field study and three online\nexperiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has\na detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such\nexchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a\nbrand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as\nface-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a\ndirective way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a\nconversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the\nconversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect\nmore freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore,\ndirective language has a stronger negative effect.

Project page:\n  https://github.com/xzf-thu/Mini-Omni-Reasoner", "summary": "Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While\nrecent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit\nreasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in\nLSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the\n\"Thinking-before-Speaking\" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,\nthis sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are\ndelayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and\ncommunication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a\nframework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel\n\"Thinking-in-Speaking\" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before\nproducing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning\ntokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows\ncontinuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,\nleveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although\ninterleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response\ntoken is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we\nintroduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for\ninterleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens\nconsistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient\nlearning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker\narchitecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken\nresponses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA\nbenchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in\ncontextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency."}

Practical QA\noften requires multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple\ndocuments, modalities, and structural formats. Although prior datasets made\nprogress in this area, they rely heavily on Wikipedia-based content and\nunimodal plain text, with shallow reasoning paths that typically produce brief\nphrase-level or single-sentence answers, thus limiting their realism and\ngeneralizability. We propose DocHop-QA, a large-scale benchmark comprising\n11,379 QA instances for multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop question\nanswering. Constructed from publicly available scientific documents sourced\nfrom PubMed, DocHop-QA is domain-agnostic and incorporates diverse information\nformats, including textual passages, tables, and structural layout cues. Unlike\nexisting datasets, DocHop-QA does not rely on explicitly hyperlinked documents;\ninstead, it supports open-ended reasoning through semantic similarity and\nlayout-aware evidence synthesis. To scale realistic QA construction, we\ndesigned an LLM-driven pipeline grounded in 11 high-frequency scientific\nquestion concepts. We evaluated DocHop-QA through four tasks spanning\nstructured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration,\nreflecting both discriminative and generative paradigms. These tasks\ndemonstrate DocHop-QA's capacity to support complex, multimodal reasoning\nacross multiple documents."}

Using a graded operationalization of salience based on\nsummary-worthiness in multiple summaries of a discourse, this paper explores\ndata from 24 spoken and written genres of English to extract a multifactorial\ncomplex of overt and implicit linguistic cues, such as recurring subjecthood or\ndefiniteness, discourse relations and hierarchy across utterances, as well as\npragmatic functional inferences based on genre and communicative intent.\nTackling the question 'how is the degree of salience expressed for each and\nevery entity mentioned?' our results show that while previous approaches to\nsalience all correlate with our salience scores to some extent, no single\ngeneralization is without exceptions, and the phenomenon cuts across all levels\nof linguistic representation."}

However, deploying these\nmodels as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments\npresents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches\ncan be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of\nreal-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper,\nwe propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero-\nand few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as\na framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology\nemphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain\nknowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical\nexpansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing\nand mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous\nmonitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between\nthe raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and\nmaintainable classification systems in industry applications."}

Existing adversarial prompt\ngeneration techniques often rely on manual engineering or rudimentary\nobfuscation, producing low-quality or incoherent text that is easily flagged by\nperplexity-based filters. We present an automated red-teaming framework that\nevolves semantically meaningful and stealthy jailbreak prompts for aligned\ncompact LLMs. The approach employs a multi-stage evolutionary search, where\ncandidate prompts are iteratively refined using a population-based strategy\naugmented with temperature-controlled variability to balance exploration and\ncoherence preservation. This enables the systematic discovery of prompts\ncapable of bypassing alignment safeguards while maintaining natural language\nfluency. We evaluate our method on benchmarks in English (In-The-Wild Jailbreak\nPrompts on LLMs), and a newly curated Arabic one derived from In-The-Wild\nJailbreak Prompts on LLMs and annotated by native Arabic linguists, enabling\nmultilingual assessment."}

Although sarcasm\nand hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether\nintegrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech\ndetection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating\nsamples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two\ntraining strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a\nCNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training\napproach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech.\nThe second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for\nsarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm\npre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and\nF1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by\n7.8% when tested only on implicit samples. By incorporating sarcasm into the\ntraining process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit\nand explicit hate."}
