This paper introduces a novel\napproach to combating misinformation by developing an AI-powered system that\nnot only fact-checks claims made in YouTube videos but also actively engages\nusers in the comment section and challenge misleading narratives. Our system\ncomprises two main agents: Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender.\n  Truth Sleuth extracts claims from a YouTube video, uses a Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) approach - drawing on sources like Wikipedia, Google Search,\nGoogle FactCheck - to accurately assess their veracity and generates a nuanced\nand comprehensive report. Through rigorous prompt engineering, Trend Bender\nleverages this report along with a curated corpus of relevant articles to\ngenerate insightful and persuasive comments designed to stimulate a productive\ndebate. With a carefully set up self-evaluation loop, this agent is able to\niteratively improve its style and refine its output.\n  We demonstrate the system's capabilities through experiments on established\nbenchmark datasets and a real-world deployment on YouTube, showcasing its\npotential to engage users and potentially influence perspectives. Our findings\nhighlight the high accuracy of our fact-checking agent, and confirm the\npotential of AI-driven interventions in combating misinformation and fostering\na more informed online space."}

To address these challenges, we propose EmoSApp (Emotional Support\nApp): an entirely offline, smartphone-based conversational app designed for\nmental health and emotional support. The system leverages Large Language Models\n(LLMs), specifically fine-tuned, quantized and deployed using Torchtune and\nExecutorch for resource-constrained devices, allowing all inferences to occur\non the smartphone.

This paper introduces SENtinel SORt (SENSOR), an automated\nonline annotation tool designed to help developers annotate and classify user\nreviews into these categories. For automating the annotation of such reviews,\nthis paper introduces the annotation model, GRACE (GRU-based Attention with\nCBOW Embedding), using Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) with Continuous Bag of Words\n(CBOW) and Attention mechanism. Approximately 16000 user reviews from seven\npopular social media apps on Google Play Store, including Instagram, Facebook,\nWhatsApp, Snapchat, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook Lite, and Line were\nanalyzed.

However, existing detection methods for data poisoning attacks on\nDL-based code search models remain insufficiently effective. To address this\ncritical security issue, we propose MT4DP, a Data Poisoning Attack Detection\nFramework for DL-based Code Search Models via Metamorphic Testing. MT4DP\nintroduces a novel Semantically Equivalent Metamorphic Relation (SE-MR)\ndesigned to detect data poisoning attacks on DL-based code search models.\nSpecifically, MT4DP first identifies the high-frequency words from search\nqueries as potential poisoning targets and takes their corresponding queries as\nthe source queries. For each source query, MT4DP generates two semantically\nequivalent follow-up queries and retrieves its source ranking list. Then, each\nsource ranking list is re-ranked based on the semantic similarities between its\ncode snippets and the follow-up queries. Finally, variances between the source\nand re-ranked lists are calculated to reveal violations of the SE-MR and warn\nthe data poisoning attack. Experimental results demonstrate that MT4DP\nsignificantly enhances the detection of data poisoning attacks on DL-based code\nsearch models, outperforming the best baseline by 191% on average F1 score and\n265% on average precision.

However, most existing works\nassume a phrase and focus on the attack's effectiveness, offering limited\nunderstanding of trigger mechanisms and how multiple triggers interact within\nthe model. In this paper, we present a framework for studying poisoning in\nLLMs. We show that multiple distinct backdoor triggers can coexist within a\nsingle model without interfering with each other, enabling adversaries to embed\nseveral triggers concurrently. Using multiple triggers with high embedding\nsimilarity, we demonstrate that poisoned triggers can achieve robust activation\neven when tokens are substituted or separated by long token spans. Our findings\nexpose a broader and more persistent vulnerability surface in LLMs. To mitigate\nthis threat, we propose a post hoc recovery method that selectively retrains\nspecific model components based on a layer-wise weight difference analysis.

Prior work shows that large language model (LLMs) tend to favor a\nsingle reasoning strategy, potentially limiting their effectiveness in diverse\nreasoning challenges. In this work, we investigate whether prompting can\ncontrol LLMs reasoning strategies and assess its impact on logical\nproblem-solving. While our experiments show that no single strategy\nconsistently improves accuracy, performance could be enhanced if models could\nadaptively choose the optimal strategy. We propose methods to guide LLMs in\nstrategy selection, highlighting new ways to refine their reasoning abilities."}

Addressing\nthe region's unique multilingual environment (Cantonese, Mandarin, and\nEnglish), its distinct socio-legal context under the \"one country, two systems\"\nframework, and specific local cultural and value considerations, the model is\nbuilt upon the DeepSeek architecture and systematically aligned with regional\nnorms through a multifaceted full parameter fine-tuning process. It is further\nintegrated with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to ensure timely\nand factually grounded information access. The core contribution lies in the\ndesign and implementation of a comprehensive, region-specific AI alignment and\nsafety framework, demonstrated through two key achievements: 1) The successful\ndevelopment of HKGAI-V1 itself - which outper-forms general-purpose models in\nhandling Hong Kong-specific culturally sensitive queries, and embodies a\n\"governance-embedded\" approach to digital sovereignty - empowers Hong Kong to\nexercise control over AI applications in critical sectors including public\nservices, legal systems, and edu-cation. 2) The development of the proprietary\nAdversarial HK Value Benchmark, a rigorous tool for evaluating model alignment\nwith local ethical and legal stand-ards under challenging conditions. By\ndocumenting these achievements, the paper provides not only a technological\nartifact but also a replicable blueprint for developing advanced, regionally\nfocused AI systems deeply rooted in their local identities."}

Through human evaluation campaigns involving categorical error\nassessment and span-level annotation, we compare traditional metrics, trainable\nmethods, and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. Our findings reveal that simpler\nmetrics like word overlap correlate surprisingly well with human judgments\n(Spearman correlation rank of 0.63), often outperforming more complex methods\nwhen applied to out-of-domain data. We further demonstrate that while LLMs can\ngenerate high-quality highlights, they prove unreliable for evaluation as they\ntend to severely under- or over-annotate. Our analysis of real-world business\nimpacts shows incorrect and non-checkable information pose the greatest risks.\nWe also highlight challenges in crowdsourced evaluations."}

Recent studies have uncovered severe data\ncontamination issues, e.g. SWE-bench reports 32.67% of successful patches\ninvolve direct solution leakage and 31.08\\% pass due to inadequate test cases.\nWe introduce SWE-MERA, a dynamic, continuously updated benchmark designed to\naddress these fundamental challenges through an automated collection of\nreal-world GitHub issues and rigorous quality validation. Our approach\nimplements a reliable pipeline that ensures quality while minimizing\ncontamination risks, resulting in approximately 10,000 potential tasks with 300\nsamples currently available.
