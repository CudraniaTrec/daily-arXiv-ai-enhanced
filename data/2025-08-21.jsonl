Its\ndifficulty lies on the fact that the story should be both grounded to the image\nsequence but also narrative and coherent. The aim of this work is to balance\nbetween these aspects, by treating Visual Storytelling as a superset of Image\nCaptioning, an approach quite different compared to most of prior relevant\nstudies. This means that we firstly employ a vision-to-language model for\nobtaining captions of the input images, and then, these captions are\ntransformed into coherent narratives using language-to-language methods. Our\nmultifarious evaluation shows that integrating captioning and storytelling\nunder a unified framework, has a positive impact on the quality of the produced\nstories. In addition, compared to numerous previous studies, this approach\naccelerates training time and makes our framework readily reusable and\nreproducible by anyone interested. Lastly, we propose a new metric/tool, named\nideality, that can be used to simulate how far some results are from an oracle\nmodel, and we apply it to emulate human-likeness in visual storytelling."}

We identify three core issues: 1) Iterative generation\nand dynamic masking ratios lead to distinct token distributions across decoding\nsteps, which are not adequately captured by existing PTQ calibration methods;\n2) Quantization errors are accumulated and amplified progressively during\niteration in DLLMs, causing quantized models to perform worse as decoding steps\nprogress; 3) Unmasked tokens stabilize while masked remain probabilistic,\nmaking overall feature distribution incompatible with existing PTQ methods. To\naddress these issues, we propose DLLMQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for DLLMs,\nwhich incorporates three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling\n(TMAS), a calibration method that accounts for both time and mask factors, with\nthe capacity to capture distributions across timesteps. 2) Interaction-Aware\nActivation Quantization (IA-AQ), which utilizes bidirectional attention's\ninteraction signals to dynamically allocate quantization resources. 3)\nCertainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), which integrates mask status and token\nscores as key weighting criteria into error compensation, making weight\nquantization more suitable for DLLMs. Experiments show that DLLMQuant achieves\nsignificant performance gains while enhancing efficiency."}

The standard way that PBT users\ngenerate test inputs is via generators that describe how to sample test inputs\nthrough random choices. To achieve a good distribution over test inputs, users\nmust tune their generators, i.e., decide on the weights of these individual\nrandom choices. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to understand how to choose\nindividual generator weights in order to achieve a desired distribution, so\ntoday this process is tedious and limits the distributions that can be\npractically achieved.\n  In this paper, we develop techniques for the automatic and offline tuning of\ngenerators. Given a generator with undetermined symbolic weights and an\nobjective function, our approach automatically learns values for these weights\nthat optimize for the objective. We describe useful objective functions that\nallow users to (1) target desired distributions and (2) improve the diversity\nand validity of their test cases. We have implemented our approach in a novel\ndiscrete probabilistic programming system, Loaded Dice, that supports\ndifferentiation and parameter learning, and use it as a language for\ngenerators. We empirically demonstrate that our approach is effective at\noptimizing generator distributions according to the specified objective\nfunctions. We also perform a thorough evaluation on PBT benchmarks,\ndemonstrating that, when automatically tuned for diversity and validity, the\ngenerators exhibit a 3.1-7.4x speedup in bug finding."}

Such\nhallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the\nintegrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address these\nchallenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware\nsEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the\nrelation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,\nDEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for\neach pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence\ninto a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise\nwhile preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local\npredictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,\ncorrecting omissions and inconsistencies.

In this paper,\nwe propose LMTransplant, a novel text augmentation paradigm leveraging LLMs.\nThe core idea of LMTransplant is transplant-then-regenerate: incorporating seed\ntext into a context expanded by LLM, and asking the LLM to regenerate a variant\nbased on the expanded context. This strategy allows the model to create more\ndiverse and creative content-level variants by fully leveraging the knowledge\nembedded in LLMs, while preserving the core attributes of the original text.
