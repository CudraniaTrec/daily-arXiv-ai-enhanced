Making Web pages accessible to all users\nrequires dedicated expertise and additional manual efforts from Web page\nproviders. To lower their efforts and promote inclusiveness, we aim to\nautomatically detect and correct Web accessibility violations in HTML code.\nWhile previous work has made progress in detecting certain types of\naccessibility violations, the problem of automatically detecting and correcting\naccessibility violations remains an open challenge that we address. We\nintroduce a novel taxonomy classifying Web accessibility violations into three\nkey categories - Syntactic, Semantic, and Layout. This taxonomy provides a\nstructured foundation for developing our detection and correction method and\nredefining evaluation metrics. We propose a novel method, AccessGuru, which\ncombines existing accessibility testing tools and Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto detect violations and applies taxonomy-driven prompting strategies to\ncorrect all three categories. To evaluate these capabilities, we develop a\nbenchmark of real-world Web accessibility violations. Our benchmark quantifies\nsyntactic and layout compliance and judges semantic accuracy through\ncomparative analysis with human expert corrections. Evaluation against our\nbenchmark shows that AccessGuru achieves up to 84% average violation score\ndecrease, significantly outperforming prior methods that achieve at most 50%."}

To understand\nthe impact that generic structured merge might have on merge accuracy and\nperformance, we run an experiment with four structured merge tools: two Java\nspecific tools, jDime and Spork, and their generic counterparts, respectively\nLastMerge and Mergiraf. Using each tool, we replay merge scenarios from a\nsignificant dataset, and collect data on runtime, behavioral divergences, and\nmerge accuracy. Our results show no evidence that generic structured merge\nsignificantly impacts merge accuracy.

The losing predicate then factorizes via\nthe Chinese remainder theorem, mirroring RSA's structure. Second, poly-MuM, our\nmodel for finite-field inversion such as the AES S-box. For poly-MuM we prove\nthe single-hole property inside its threshold region, implying that the\nSprague-Grundy values are multiplicative under disjunctive sums in that region.\nBeyond these instances, we establish four structural theorems for a general\nProduct-Congruence Game PCG($m,R$): (i) single-heap repair above the modulus,\n(ii) ultimate period $m$ per coordinate, (iii) exact and asymptotic losing\ndensities, and (iv) confinement of optimal play to a finite indeterminacy\nregion.

One key desirable capability for speech language\nmodels is the ability to capture the intricate interdependency between content\nand prosody. The existing mainstream paradigm of training speech language\nmodels, which converts speech into discrete tokens before feeding them into\nLLMs, is sub-optimal in learning prosody information -- we find that the\nresulting LLMs do not exhibit obvious emerging prosody processing capabilities\nvia pre-training alone. To overcome this, we propose ProsodyLM, which\nintroduces a simple tokenization scheme amenable to learning prosody. Each\nspeech utterance is first transcribed into text, followed by a sequence of\nword-level prosody tokens.

The model\nbuilds upon the UK-DYNAMO framework and integrates principles of articulatory\nunderspecification, segmental and gestural control, and coarticulation.\nDYNARTmo simulates six key articulators based on ten continuous and six\ndiscrete control parameters, allowing for the generation of both vocalic and\nconsonantal articulatory configurations. The current implementation is embedded\nin a web-based application (SpeechArticulationTrainer) that includes sagittal,\nglottal, and palatal views, making it suitable for use in phonetics education\nand speech therapy.

To address\nthis limitation, we introduce RMTBench, a comprehensive \\textbf{user-centric}\nbilingual role-playing benchmark featuring 80 diverse characters and over 8,000\ndialogue rounds. RMTBench includes custom characters with detailed backgrounds\nand abstract characters defined by simple traits, enabling evaluation across\nvarious user scenarios.

Through experiments comparing language-specific and mixed-language\nfine-tuning approaches, we demonstrate a consistent relationship between an\nLLM's general language capabilities and its performance in language-specific\nevaluation tasks. Our framework shows improvements over existing baselines,\nincluding state-of-the-art English evaluators and machine translation-based\napproaches."}

With\nthe emergence of pretrained language models (PLMs), general-purpose text\nembeddings (GPTE) have gained significant traction for their ability to produce\nrich, transferable representations. The general architecture of GPTE typically\nleverages PLMs to derive dense text representations, which are then optimized\nthrough contrastive learning on large-scale pairwise datasets. In this survey,\nwe provide a comprehensive overview of GPTE in the era of PLMs, focusing on the\nroles PLMs play in driving its development. We first examine the fundamental\narchitecture and describe the basic roles of PLMs in GPTE, i.e., embedding\nextraction, expressivity enhancement, training strategies, learning objectives,\nand data construction. Then, we describe advanced roles enabled by PLMs, such\nas multilingual support, multimodal integration, code understanding, and\nscenario-specific adaptation. Finally, we highlight potential future research\ndirections that move beyond traditional improvement goals, including ranking\nintegration, safety considerations, bias mitigation, structural information\nincorporation, and the cognitive extension of embeddings.

We evaluated whether a fully\nautomated, open source \"text-to-table\" language-model pipeline (PFD Toolkit)\ncould reproduce the ONS's identification and thematic analysis of child-suicide\nPFD reports, and assessed gains in efficiency and reliability. All 4,249 PFD\nreports published from July 2013 to November 2023 were processed via PFD\nToolkit's large language model pipelines. Automated screening identified cases\nwhere the coroner attributed death to suicide in individuals aged 18 or\nyounger, and eligible reports were coded for recipient category and 23 concern\nsub-themes, replicating the ONS coding frame. PFD Toolkit identified 72\nchild-suicide PFD reports - almost twice the ONS count. Three blinded\nclinicians adjudicated a stratified sample of 144 reports to validate the\nchild-suicide screening. Against the post-consensus clinical annotations, the\nLLM-based workflow showed substantial to almost-perfect agreement (Cohen's\n$\\kappa$ = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, raw agreement = 91%).

We survey articles in the ACL Anthology from\nthe past 6 years, with \"diversity\" or \"diverse\" in their title. We find a wide\nrange of settings in which diversity is quantified, often highly specialized\nand using inconsistent terminology. We put forward a unified taxonomy of why,\nwhat on, where, and how diversity is measured in NLP. Diversity measures are\ncast upon a unified framework from ecology and economy (Stirling, 2007) with 3\ndimensions of diversity: variety, balance and disparity.

Soft injection is performed by\nsoftly mixing task embeddings with attention head activations using\npre-optimized mixing parameters, referred to as soft head-selection parameters.\nThis method not only allows a desired task to be performed without in-prompt\ndemonstrations but also significantly outperforms existing ICL approaches while\nreducing memory usage and compute cost at inference time. An extensive\nevaluation is performed across 57 tasks and 12 LLMs, spanning four model\nfamilies of sizes from 4B to 70B. Averaged across 57 tasks, our method\noutperforms 10-shot ICL by 10.1%-13.9% across 12 LLMs. Additional analyses show\nthat our method also serves as an insightful tool for analyzing task-relevant\nroles of attention heads, revealing that task-relevant head positions selected\nby our method transfer across similar tasks but not across dissimilar ones --\nunderscoring the task-specific nature of head functionality.

We implement three models to address\neach subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck\nModel (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a\nfine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as\nhuman-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models\n(LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of\nadjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks.\nSCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual\nembeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification\nperformance.
