To achieve this, we conducted an investigation into the\nstate of the art of micro frontends, based on both academic and gray\nliterature. We then implemented this architectural style in a marketplace for\nhandcrafted products, which already used microservices. Finally, we evaluated\nthe implementation through a semi-open questionnaire with the developers. At\nthe studied marketplace company, the need for architectural change arose due to\nthe tight coupling between their main system (a Java monolith) and a dedicated\nfrontend system. Additionally, there were deprecated technologies and poor\ndeveloper experience. To address these issues, the micro frontends architecture\nwas adopted, along with the API Gateway and Backend for Frontend patterns, and\ntechnologies such as Svelte and Fastify. Although the adoption of Micro\nFrontends was successful, it was not strictly necessary to meet the company's\nneeds.

What made adopting micro frontends the most convenient choice in the\ncompany's context was the monolith strangulation and microservices adoption,\nwhich facilitated implementation through infrastructure reuse and knowledge\nsharing between teams."}

Next,\nwe present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that substantially reduces\nmemory and compute costs while maintaining competitive performance.

This paper\ndescribes a method for meta-training LMs such that gradient updates emulate the\neffects of conditioning on new information.

There is also a growing expectation for them\nto display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this\nexpectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM\npersonalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models\nface two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which\nonly provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for\ncontrolling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending\nthe Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five\nmodel, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing\nexpressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured\nframework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and\ndynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces\nadjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and\nleverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:\n\\textit{Frequency}, \\textit{Depth}, \\textit{Threshold}, \\textit{Effort}, and\n\\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity\nas a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable\npersonality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe\nthat changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related\ntraits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize\nmulti-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in\nisolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine\ninteractions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing\nprocesses, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines."}

A promising approach is to\nuse reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select\nreward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench\ntargeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench,\na benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The\nbenchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and\nreal-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and\nsafety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation.
