To this end, we\nextend existing operational semantics to support these language features. By\ntranslating a program to its control-flow graph, we define a sound static\nanalysis that approximates the dependency structure of the random variables in\nthe program.

In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines\nto promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are\ntypically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in\ntranslating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.\n  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\\textbf{G}uideline\n\\textbf{U}pholding Test through \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{R}ole-play and\nJailbreak \\textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize\nguidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM\nadherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of\nguideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby\ntesting whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly\nviolate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses\nthat do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of\n``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that\nprovoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying\npotential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method\nfinally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence\nand highlighting any violations.\n  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,\nincluding Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,\nGPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued\nguidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can\ntransfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its\nusage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications."}

In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH)\ngraph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require\ndeep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are\ncore characteristics of Long CoT reasoning.

In addition, CPS simulators may be\nflaky, leading to inconsistent test outcomes and requiring repeated test\nre-execution for reliable test verdicts. Automated test oracles that do not\nrequire system execution are therefore crucial for reducing testing costs.\nIdeally, such test oracles should be interpretable to facilitate human\nunderstanding of test verdicts, and they must be robust against the potential\nflakiness of CPS simulators. In this article, we propose assertion-based test\noracles for CPS as sets of logical and arithmetic predicates defined over the\ninputs of the system under test. Given a test input, our assertion-based test\noracle determines, without requiring test execution, whether the test passes,\nfails, or if the oracle is inconclusive in predicting a verdict. We describe\ntwo methods for generating assertion-based test oracles: one using genetic\nprogramming~(GP) that employs well-known spectrum-based fault localization\n(SBFL) ranking formulas, namely Ochiai, Tarantula, and Naish, as fitness\nfunctions; and the other using decision trees (DT) and decision rules (DR). We\nevaluate our assertion-based test oracles through case studies in the domains\nof aerospace, networking and autonomous driving. We show that test oracles\ngenerated using GP with Ochiai are significantly more accurate than those\nobtained using GP with Tarantula and Naish or using DT or DR. Moreover, this\naccuracy advantage remains even when accounting for the flakiness of the system\nunder test. We further show that the assertion-based test oracles generated by\nGP with Ochiai are robust against flakiness with only 4% average variation in\ntheir accuracy results across four different network and autonomous driving\nsystems with flaky behaviours."}

Specifically, we\nmeasure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step\nusing conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the\nvocabulary) with context expanding step by step.

Existing approaches\npredominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical\ninsights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information\nwithin structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce\nand assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing\ntechniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource\nutilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR\ndatasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with\nleading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key\ncomponents in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained\nsentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the\ncorruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world\ndatasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved\nperformance metrics by 1.6\\%/0.8\\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction,\n0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical\nduration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently\ndemonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three\ntasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an\neffective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and\nresource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of\nusing prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs.\nImportantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within\nstructured data, especially at high corruption levels."}

Recent research has\ndemonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or\nremoving specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,\nwe propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box\nmethod that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its\nactivations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,\nfine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream\nwrite matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set\nof harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently\nincreases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while\npreserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,\nHellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align\n'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,\ndemonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our\nresults suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and\npotent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive\nfine-tuning paradigms."}
