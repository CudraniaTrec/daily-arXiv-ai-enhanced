To maintain service, any\nmodifications to the service functionality must be made on the fly -- i.e., as\nthe service continues to process client requests -- but doing so is\nchallenging. The central difficulty is that of avoiding potential\ninconsistencies caused by ''mixed mode'' operation, where workers of current\nand new versions are concurrently active and interact via the data store. Some\nupdate methods avoid mixed mode altogether, but only at the cost of substantial\ninefficiency -- by doubling resources (memory and compute), or by halving\nthroughput. The alternative is a so-called ''rolling'' update, which is\nuncontrolled and runs the risk of serious service failures arising from\ninconsistent mixed-mode behavior.\n  In this paper, we present the first algorithms that guarantee consistency for\nmixed mode updates. The algorithms rely on semantic properties of service\nactions, such as commutativity. We show that semantic awareness is required, by\nproving that any semantically oblivious, mixed-mode update method cannot avoid\ninconsistencies. Ideally, it should appear to every client that a service\nupdate takes effect atomically; this ensures that a client is not exposed to\ninconsistent mixed-mode behavior. We introduce a framework that formalizes this\nintuition and develop foundational theory for reasoning about the consistency\nof mixed-mode updates, applying that theory to derive the new algorithms and\nestablish their correctness."}

It involves assigning\nflights to aircraft while ensuring regular visits to maintenance bases. This\npaper examines two aspects of the problem.\n  First, we explore the relationship between periodic instances, where flights\nare the same every day, and periodic solutions. The literature has implicitly\nassumed-without discussion-that periodic instances necessitate periodic\nsolutions, and even periodic solutions in a stronger form, where every two\nairplanes perform either the exact same cyclic sequence of flights, or\ncompletely disjoint cyclic sequences. However, enforcing such periodicity may\neliminate feasible solutions. We prove that, when regular maintenance is\nrequired at most every four days, there always exist periodic solutions of this\nform.\n  Second, we consider the computational hardness of the problem.

This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and\nfinancial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To\nremedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of\nthe widely-used BPE algorithm.

In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a\ndiverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by\nmulti-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves\nLoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural\ndiversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct\nchallenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head\narchitecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex\nmulti-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the\nmulti-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard\nsingle-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly\ncompetitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective\nMTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not\nisolating task-specific features. To validate this, we propose Align-LoRA,\nwhich incorporates an explicit loss to align task representations within the\nshared adapter space.

First, to enable\nreasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference\npairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score\nreasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method\nfor reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs\nby systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along\ncurated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical\nrigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other\nbenchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method\nthat conditions process-based rewards on task success.

However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based\nrewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning\nprocess. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising\ndirection, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model\nlearns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes.\nTo address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively\nincorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable\nreasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference\npairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score\nreasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method\nfor reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs\nby systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along\ncurated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical\nrigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other\nbenchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method\nthat conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying\nrewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO\neffectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning\nwith final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior\nperformance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only\nbaselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo. We further\ndemonstrate the generalizability of our approach by extending it to\nmathematical tasks. Our models, dataset, and code are publicly available."}
