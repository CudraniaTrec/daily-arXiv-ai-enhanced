However,\nrepeated executions can be impractical in the presence of non-deterministic\nfailures or high execution costs. While recent efforts have leveraged Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to aid execution-free FL, these have primarily focused\non identifying faults in the system under test (SUT) rather than in the often\ncomplex system test code. However, the latter is also important as, in\npractice, many failures are triggered by faulty test code. To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce a fully static, LLM-driven approach for system test\ncode fault localization (TCFL) that does not require executing the test case.\nOur method uses a single failure execution log to estimate the test's execution\ntrace through three novel algorithms that identify only code statements likely\ninvolved in the failure. This pruned trace, combined with the error message, is\nused to prompt the LLM to rank potential faulty locations. Our black-box,\nsystem-level approach requires no access to the SUT source code and is\napplicable to large test scripts that assess full system behavior. We evaluate\nour technique at function, block, and line levels using an industrial dataset\nof faulty test cases not previously used in pre-training LLMs. Results show\nthat our best estimated trace closely match actual traces, with an F1 score of\naround 90%. Additionally, pruning the complex system test code reduces the\nLLM's inference time by up to 34% without any loss in FL performance.

This pipeline encompasses three rule-based reasoning tasks, a\nsupporting theoretical framework, and a practical end-to-end architecture. The\nexperiment illustrates the following findings: Disentangled reasoning: Under\nexplicit signal supervision, reasoning rules - viewed as functional mappings -\ncan be disentangled within the encoder's parametric space. This separation\nresults in distinct clustering of rules in the output feature space. Prior\nknowledge injection: injecting reasoning information into the Query enables the\nmodel to more effectively retrieve the stored value Value from memory based on\nKey. This approach offers a simple method for integrating prior knowledge into\ndecoder-only language models. Performance bottleneck: In mathematical reasoning\ntasks using Qwen2.5(0.5B), increasing sample count doesn't improve performance\nbeyond a point. Moreover, ffn layers are better than attention layers at\npreserving the separation of reasoning rules in the model's parameters."}

While recent work in efficient\nreasoning seeks to reduce reasoning length while preserving accuracy, it\nremains unclear whether such optimization is truly a free lunch. Drawing on the\nintuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model\nresponses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether\nefficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To\nsystematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to\nmeasure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across\ntask settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned\nbehavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and\nself-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs,\nwe find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than\nsmaller ones, they all display widespread \"scheming\" behaviors, including\nself-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning\ncues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies\nsuch as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three\ndefined types of inconsistency.

Replacing Multi-Head-Attention with Bidirectional Recurrent Attention for Long-Form ASR", "comment": "Accepted to Interspeech 2025", "summary": "Long-form speech recognition is an application area of increasing research\nfocus. ASR models based on multi-head attention (MHA) are ill-suited to\nlong-form ASR because of their quadratic complexity in sequence length. We\nbuild on recent work that has investigated linear complexity recurrent\nattention (RA) layers for ASR. We find that bidirectional RA layers can match\nthe accuracy of MHA for both short- and long-form applications. We present a\nstrong limited-context attention (LCA) baseline, and show that RA layers are\njust as accurate while being more efficient. We develop a long-form training\nparadigm which further improves RA performance, leading to better accuracy than\nLCA with 44% higher throughput. We also present Direction Dropout, a novel\nregularization method that improves accuracy, provides fine-grained control of\nthe accuracy/throughput trade-off of bidirectional RA, and enables a new\nalternating directions decoding mode with even higher throughput."}

Through\ncomprehensive analysis of token distributions, learning dynamics, and\nintegration mechanisms from entropy-based perspectives, we reveal key\ndifferences between these paradigms: SFT induces coarse-grained global changes\nto LLM policy distributions, while RL performs fine-grained selective\noptimizations, with entropy serving as a critical indicator of training\neffectiveness. Building on these observations, we propose Supervised\nReinforcement Fine-Tuning (SRFT), a single-stage method that unifies both\nfine-tuning paradigms through entropy-aware weighting mechanisms. Our approach\nsimultaneously applies SFT and RL to directly optimize the LLM using\ndemonstrations and self-exploration rollouts rather than through two-stage\nsequential methods. Extensive experiments show that SRFT achieves 59.1% average\naccuracy, outperforming zero-RL methods by 9.0% on five mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks and 10.9% on three out-of-distribution benchmarks."}

In this work, we investigate strategies to\nenhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed\ndataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate models across three\ndimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our\nanalysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as\nthe primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task\ncomplexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality\ndemonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance.\nWe leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology,\ndemonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical\nreasoning capabilities."}

Iftekhar Islam Tashik", "S M Ishtiak Mahmud", "Farig Sadeque"], "title": "How Effectively Can BERT Models Interpret Context and Detect Bengali Communal Violent Text?", "comment": null, "summary": "The spread of cyber hatred has led to communal violence, fueling aggression\nand conflicts between various religious, ethnic, and social groups, posing a\nsignificant threat to social harmony. Despite its critical importance, the\nclassification of communal violent text remains an underexplored area in\nexisting research. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of detecting text\nthat incites communal violence, focusing specifically on Bengali textual data\nsourced from social media platforms. We introduce a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model\ntailored for this task, achieving a macro F1 score of 0.60. To address the\nissue of data imbalance, our dataset was expanded by adding 1,794 instances,\nwhich facilitated the development and evaluation of a fine-tuned ensemble\nmodel. This ensemble model demonstrated an improved performance, achieving a\nmacro F1 score of 0.63, thus highlighting its effectiveness in this domain. In\naddition to quantitative performance metrics, qualitative analysis revealed\ninstances where the models struggled with context understanding, leading to\noccasional misclassifications, even when predictions were made with high\nconfidence. Through analyzing the cosine similarity between words, we\nidentified certain limitations in the pre-trained BanglaBERT models,\nparticularly in their ability to distinguish between closely related communal\nand non-communal terms. To further interpret the model's decisions, we applied\nLIME, which helped to uncover specific areas where the model struggled in\nunderstanding context, contributing to errors in classification. These findings\nhighlight the promise of NLP and interpretability tools in reducing online\ncommunal violence. Our work contributes to the growing body of research in\ncommunal violence detection and offers a foundation for future studies aiming\nto refine these techniques for better accuracy and societal impact."}

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis\n(MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role\nassignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical\ndiagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist\nTeam, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an\nLLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient\nknowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases.\nExtensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly\naccessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and\nvideo modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance\nof modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance\nimprovements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models.

Supporting multilingual programming -- i.e., coding tasks across\nmultiple programming languages -- typically requires either (1) finetuning a\nsingle LLM across all programming languages, which is cost-efficient but\nsacrifices language-specific specialization and performance, or (2) finetuning\nseparate LLMs for each programming language, which allows for specialization\nbut is computationally expensive and storage-intensive due to the duplication\nof parameters. This paper introduces MoLE (Mix-of-Language-Experts), a novel\narchitecture that balances efficiency and specialization for multilingual\nprogramming. MoLE is composed of a base model, a shared LoRA (low-rank\nadaptation) module, and a collection of language-specific LoRA modules. These\nmodules are jointly optimized during the finetuning process, enabling effective\nknowledge sharing and specialization across programming languages. During\ninference, MoLE automatically routes to the language-specific LoRA module\ncorresponding to the programming language of the code token being generated.\nOur experiments demonstrate that MoLE achieves greater parameter efficiency\ncompared to training separate language-specific LoRAs, while outperforming a\nsingle shared LLM finetuned for all programming languages in terms of accuracy."}
