In this study, we investigated the prevalence of\ncommunity smells and their relationship with SATD in open-source ML projects,\nanalyzing data at the release level. First, we examined the prevalence of ten\ncommunity smell types across the releases of 155 ML-based systems and found\nthat community smells are widespread, exhibiting distinct distribution patterns\nacross small, medium, and large projects. Second, we detected SATD at the\nrelease level and applied statistical analysis to examine its correlation with\ncommunity smells. Our results showed that certain smells, such as Radio Silence\nand Organizational Silos, are strongly correlated with higher SATD occurrences.\nThird, we considered the six identified types of SATD to determine which\ncommunity smells are most associated with each debt category. Our analysis\nrevealed authority- and communication-related smells often co-occur with\npersistent code and design debt. Finally, we analyzed how the community smells\nand SATD evolve over the releases, uncovering project size-dependent trends and\nshared trajectories.

In multimodal scenarios, LLMs need to rely on\nvisual information in the graphical user interface (GUI) to understand bugs and\ngenerate fixes. To bridge this gap, we propose GUIRepair, a cross-modal\nreasoning approach for resolving multimodal issue scenarios by understanding\nand capturing visual information. Specifically, GUIRepair integrates two key\ncomponents, Image2Code and Code2Image, to enhance fault comprehension and patch\nvalidation. Image2Code extracts relevant project documents based on the issue\nreport, then applies this domain knowledge to generate the reproduced code\nresponsible for the visual symptoms, effectively translating GUI images into\nexecutable context for better fault comprehension. Code2Image replays the\nvisual issue scenario using the reproduced code and captures GUI renderings of\nthe patched program to assess whether the fix visually resolves the issue,\nproviding feedback for patch validation. We evaluate GUIRepair on SWE-bench M,\nand the approach demonstrates significant effectiveness. When utilizing GPT-4o\nas the base model, GUIRepair solves 157 instances, outperforming the best\nopen-source baseline by 26 instances.

Recently, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have emerged as an alternative approach for formal\nreasoning tasks, but their effectiveness in verifying requirements over strings\nis less studied. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach that verifies\nthe satisfiability of NL requirements over strings by using LLMs (1) to derive\na satisfiability outcome (and a consistent string, if possible), and (2) to\ngenerate declarative (i.e., SMT) and imperative (i.e., Python) checkers, used\nto validate the correctness of (1). In our experiments, we assess the\nperformance of four LLMs. Results show that LLMs effectively translate natural\nlanguage into checkers, even achieving perfect testing accuracy for\nPython-based checkers. These checkers substantially help LLMs in generating a\nconsistent string and accurately identifying unsatisfiable requirements,\nleading to more than doubled generation success rate and F1-score in certain\ncases compared to baselines without generated checkers."}

PROD suppresses the probability\nof forget data in LLMs' output distribution while promoting candidate\ndistributional components, enabling the model to jointly learn to forget\nspecific content and retain its general capabilities. To facilitate this study,\nwe establish a benchmark for code unlearning evaluation, which includes three\ncritical downstream tasks: copyrighted code unlearning, insecure code\nunlearning, and deprecated API unlearning. Our evaluation demonstrates that\nPROD achieves superior balance between forget quality and model utility\ncompared to existing unlearning approaches across three downstream tasks, while\nconsistently exhibiting improvements when applied to LLMs of varying series.\nPROD also exhibits superior robustness against adversarial attacks without\ngenerating or exposing the data to be forgotten. The results underscore that\nour approach not only extends the application boundary of unlearning techniques\nto source code, but also holds significant implications for advancing reliable\ncode generation."}

We show\nthat this subclass of transformers is expressively equivalent to the\nprogramming language C-RASP and this equivalence preserves depth. Second, we\nprove that deeper C-RASP programs are more expressive than shallower C-RASP\nprograms, implying that deeper transformers are more expressive than shallower\ntransformers (within the subclass mentioned above).

If, as linguistic relativity suggests, the structure\nof language shapes cognitive patterns, then large language models (LLMs)\ntrained on human language may also internalize the habitual logical structures\nembedded in different languages. To examine this hypothesis, we introduce\nBICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes\nsemantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed\ncausal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit\ntypologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and\nsentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced\ndistribution in English. (2) Models internalize language-specific preferences\nfor causal word order and often rigidly apply them to atypical inputs, leading\nto degraded performance, especially in Chinese.

To investigate this trade-off, we\nconduct experiments on Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks and find that\nmitigating prompt-introduced bias improves uncertainty quantification in\nGPT-4o. Building on prior work showing that LLMs tend to copy input information\nwhen model confidence is low, we further analyze how these prompt biases affect\nmeasured epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty across varying bias-free\nconfidence levels with GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL.

This capability has implications for security and accountability\nin language model deployments, such as leaking private information from an\nAPI-protected language model's system message. We propose a new method --\nprompt inversion from logprob sequences (PILS) -- that recovers hidden prompts\nby gleaning clues from the model's next-token probabilities over the course of\nmultiple generation steps. Our method is enabled by a key insight: The\nvector-valued outputs of a language model occupy a low-dimensional subspace.\nThis enables us to losslessly compress the full next-token probability\ndistribution over multiple generation steps using a linear map, allowing more\noutput information to be used for inversion. Our approach yields massive gains\nover previous state-of-the-art methods for recovering hidden prompts, achieving\n2--3.5 times higher exact recovery rates across test sets, in one case\nincreasing the recovery rate from 17% to 60%. Our method also exhibits\nsurprisingly good generalization behavior; for instance, an inverter trained on\n16 generations steps gets 5--27 points higher prompt recovery when we increase\nthe number of steps to 32 at test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong\nperformance of our method on the more challenging task of recovering hidden\nsystem messages. We also analyze the role of verbatim repetition in prompt\nrecovery and propose a new method for cross-family model transfer for\nlogit-based inverters. Our findings show that next-token probabilities are a\nconsiderably more vulnerable attack surface for inversion attacks than\npreviously known."}

Many prior works have proposed ways of discarding KVs from memory, but\ntheir approaches are tailored to favorable settings, obscuring caveats like\nhigh peak memory and performance degradation, and a fair comparison between\nmethods is difficult. In this paper, we propose the *KV footprint* as a unified\nmetric, which accounts for both the amount of KV entries stored and their\nlifespan in memory. We evaluate methods based on the smallest footprint they\nattain while preserving performance in both long-context understanding and\ngeneration, with context lengths of up to 128K tokens. This metric reveals the\nhigh peak memory of prior KV eviction methods. One class of methods --\n*post-fill eviction* -- has a high footprint due to being incompatible with\neviction during pre-filling. We adapt these methods to be able to evict KVs\nduring pre-filling, achieving substantially lower KV footprints. We then turn\nto *recency eviction* methods, wherein we propose PruLong, an end-to-end\noptimization method for learning which attention heads need to retain the full\nKV cache and which do not. PruLong saves memory while preserving long-context\nperformance, achieving 12% smaller KV footprint than prior methods while\nretaining performance in challenging recall tasks. Our paper clarifies the\ncomplex tangle of long-context inference methods and paves the way for future\ndevelopment to minimize the KV footprint."}

Through comprehensive evaluation of\n21 state-of-the-art language models (ranging from 0.5B to 72B parameters), we\nidentify two fundamental findings. First, language models frequently confuse\nsemantic similarity with causality, relying on lexical and semantic overlap\ninstead of inferring actual causal explanatory relationships.

To make\nany meaningful progress in mitigating this issue, we first need reliable and\nreproducible safety evaluations.
