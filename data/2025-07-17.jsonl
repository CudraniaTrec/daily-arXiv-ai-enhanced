Organizations can\nleverage this analysis, for example to check whether their processes comply\nwith internal or external regulations or to identify potential improvements.\nGaining these insights requires suitable visualizations, which make complex\nresults accessible and actionable. So far, however, the development of\nconformance checking visualizations has largely been left to tool vendors. As a\nresult, current tools offer a wide variety of visual representations for\nconformance checking, but the analytical purposes they serve often remain\nunclear. However, without a systematic understanding of these purposes, it is\ndifficult to evaluate the visualizations' usefulness. Such an evaluation hence\nrequires a deeper understanding of conformance checking as an analysis domain.\nTo this end, we propose a task taxonomy, which categorizes the tasks that can\noccur when conducting conformance checking analyses. This taxonomy supports\nresearchers in determining the purpose of visualizations, specifying relevant\nconformance checking tasks in terms of their goal, means, constraint type, data\ncharacteristics, data target, and data cardinality. Combining concepts from\nprocess mining and visual analytics, we address researchers from both\ndisciplines to enable and support closer collaborations."}

Intelligent pricing enables competitive analysis, streamlines\noperational decision-making, and supports continuous pricing evolution in\nresponse to market dynamics, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy.

Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal\nbehaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal\ndirection. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety\nmechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a\nseparate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is\ndistinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the\nharmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as\nharmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal\nresponses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.\nFurthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain\njailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially\nfinetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical\nsafety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as\nan intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing\nover-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks.

Sensemaking is\none such shared task.\n  In Sensemaking, we try to assess how well generative models ``make sense out\nof a given text'' in three steps inspired by exams in a classroom setting: (1)\nTeacher systems should prepare a set of questions, (2) Student systems should\nanswer these questions, and (3) Evaluator systems should score these answers,\nall adhering rather strictly to a given set of input materials.\n  We report on the 2025 edition of Sensemaking, where we had 7 sources of test\nmaterials (fact-checking analyses of statements, textbooks, transcribed\nrecordings of a lecture, and educational videos) spanning English, German,\nUkrainian, and Czech languages.\n  This year, 4 teams participated, providing us with 2 Teacher submissions, 2\nStudent submissions, and 2 Evaluator submissions. We added baselines for\nTeacher and Student using commercial large language model systems. We devised a\nfully automatic evaluation procedure, which we compare to a minimalistic manual\nevaluation.\n  We were able to make some interesting observations. For the first task, the\ncreation of questions, better evaluation strategies will still have to be\ndevised because it is difficult to discern the quality of the various candidate\nquestion sets. In the second task, question answering, the LLMs examined\noverall perform acceptably, but restricting their answers to the given input\ntexts remains problematic. In the third task, evaluation of question answers,\nour adversarial tests reveal that systems using the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm\nerroneously rate both garbled question-answer pairs and answers to mixed-up\nquestions as acceptable."}
