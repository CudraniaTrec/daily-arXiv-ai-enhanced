Results: Among 321 GitHub projects using\nSonarQube Cloud, 81% of them are correctly connected to SonarQube Cloud\nprojects, while others exhibit misconfigurations or restricted access. Among\n265 accessible SonarQube Cloud projects, 75% use the organization's default\nquality gate, i.e., a set of conditions that deployed source code must meet to\npass automated checks. While 55% of the projects use the built-in quality gate\nprovided by SonarQube Cloud, 45% of them customize their quality gate with\ndifferent conditions. Overall, the most common quality conditions align with\nSonarQube Cloud's \"Clean as You Code\" principle and enforce security,\nmaintainability, reliability, coverage, and a few duplicates on newly added or\nmodified source code. Conclusions: Many projects rely on predefined\nconfigurations, yet a significant portion customize their configurations to\nmeet specific quality goals. Building on our initial results, we envision a\nfuture research agenda linking quality gate configurations to actual software\noutcomes (e.g., improvement of software security). This would enable\nevidence-based recommendations for configuring SCA tools like SonarQube Cloud\nin various contexts."}

Although promising results are achieved\nvia experimental analysis, an in-depth understanding of the LLM's internal\nworkings is unavoidable to comprehend the reasoning behind the re-ranking,\nwhich provides end users with an explanation that enables them to make an\ninformed decision. Moreover, in newly developed systems with limited user\nengagement and insufficient ranking data, accurately re-ranking content remains\na significant challenge. While various training methods affect the training of\nLLMs and generate inference, our analysis has found that some training methods\nexhibit better explainability than others, implying that an accurate semantic\nunderstanding has not been learned through all training methods; instead,\nabstract knowledge has been gained to optimize evaluation, which raises\nquestions about the true reliability of LLMs. Therefore, in this work, we\nanalyze how different training methods affect the semantic understanding of the\nre-ranking task in LLMs and investigate whether these models can generate more\ninformed textual reasoning to overcome the challenges of transparency or LLMs\nand limited training data. To analyze the LLMs for re-ranking tasks, we utilize\na relatively small ranking dataset from the environment and the Earth science\ndomain to re-rank retrieved content.

However, current approaches struggle with two key\nproblems: The generated programs for testing compilers are often too simple,\nand extensive testing with the LLMs is computationally expensive. In this\npaper, we propose a novel compiler testing framework that decouples the testing\nprocess into two distinct phases: an offline phase and an online phase. In the\noffline phase, we use LLMs to generate a collection of small but feature-rich\ncode pieces. In the online phase, we reuse these code pieces by strategically\ncombining them to build high-quality and valid test programs, which are then\nused to test compilers.\n  We implement this idea in a tool, LegoFuzz, for testing C compilers. The\nresults are striking: we found 66 bugs in GCC and LLVM, the most widely used C\ncompilers. Almost half of the bugs are miscompilation bugs, which are serious\nand hard-to-find bugs that none of the existing LLM-based tools could find.

This paper delivers the first comprehensive analysis of whether LLMs can\nacquire such languages purely via in-context learning (ICL), with or without\nauxiliary alignment signals, and how these methods compare to\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We systematically evaluate 20\nunder-represented languages across three state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs.\nOur findings highlight the limitation of PEFT when both language and its script\nare extremely under-represented by the LLM. In contrast, zero-shot ICL with\nlanguage alignment is impressively effective on extremely low-resource\nlanguages, while few-shot ICL or PEFT is more beneficial for languages\nrelatively better represented by LLMs. For LLM practitioners working on\nextremely low-resource languages, we summarise guidelines grounded by our\nresults on adapting LLMs to low-resource languages, e.g., avoiding fine-tuning\na multilingual model on languages of unseen scripts."}

Provenance\nresearch establishes the ownership history of artworks, which is essential for\nverifying authenticity, supporting restitution and legal claims, and\nunderstanding the cultural and historical context of art objects. The process\nis complicated by fragmented, multilingual archival data that hinders efficient\nretrieval. Current search portals require precise metadata, limiting\nexploratory searches. Our method enables natural-language and multilingual\nsearches through semantic retrieval and contextual summarization, reducing\ndependence on metadata structures. We assess RAG's capability to retrieve and\nsummarize auction records using a 10,000-record sample from the Getty\nProvenance Index - German Sales. The results show this approach provides a\nscalable solution for navigating art market archives, offering a practical tool\nfor historians and cultural heritage professionals conducting historically\nsensitive research."}

However, reliance on black box\nsoftware such as MAXQDA and NVivo risks undermining methodological transparency\nand alignment with research goals. This paper presents a hybrid, transparent\nframework for QDA that combines lexical and semantic methods to enable\ntriangulation, reproducibility, and interpretability. Drawing from a case study\nin historical political discourse, we demonstrate how custom Python pipelines\nusing NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers allow fine-grained control over\npreprocessing, lemmatisation, and embedding generation. We further detail our\niterative BERTopic modelling process, incorporating UMAP dimensionality\nreduction, HDBSCAN clustering, and c-TF-IDF keyword extraction, optimised\nthrough parameter tuning and multiple runs to enhance topic coherence and\ncoverage. By juxtaposing precise lexical searches with context-aware semantic\nclustering, we argue for a multi-layered approach that mitigates the\nlimitations of either method in isolation. Our workflow underscores the\nimportance of code-level transparency, researcher agency, and methodological\ntriangulation in computational discourse studies.

A Systematic Study of Knowledge Boundary Perception in LVLMs", "comment": "EMNLP2025 Findings", "summary": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong visual question\nanswering (VQA) capabilities but are shown to hallucinate. A reliable model\nshould perceive its knowledge boundaries-knowing what it knows and what it does\nnot. This paper investigates LVLMs' perception of their knowledge boundaries by\nevaluating three types of confidence signals: probabilistic confidence, answer\nconsistency-based confidence, and verbalized confidence. Experiments on three\nLVLMs across three VQA datasets show that, although LVLMs possess a reasonable\nperception level, there is substantial room for improvement. Among the three\nconfidences, probabilistic and consistency-based signals are more reliable\nindicators, while verbalized confidence often leads to overconfidence. To\nenhance LVLMs' perception, we adapt several established confidence calibration\nmethods from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose three effective methods.\nAdditionally, we compare LVLMs with their LLM counterparts, finding that\njointly processing visual and textual inputs decreases question-answering\nperformance but reduces confidence, resulting in an improved perception level\ncompared to LLMs."}

While automated scientific reasoners hold great promise for\nassisting human scientists, there is currently no widely adopted holistic\nbenchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning, and few approaches\nsystematically disentangle the distinct roles of knowledge and reasoning in\nthese tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce SciReas, a diverse suite of\nexisting benchmarks for scientific reasoning tasks, and SciReas-Pro, a\nselective subset that requires more complex reasoning. Our holistic evaluation\nsurfaces insights about scientific reasoning performance that remain hidden\nwhen relying on individual benchmarks alone. We then propose KRUX, a probing\nframework for studying the distinct roles of reasoning and knowledge in\nscientific tasks. Combining the two, we conduct an in-depth analysis that\nyields several key findings: (1) Retrieving task-relevant knowledge from model\nparameters is a critical bottleneck for LLMs in scientific reasoning; (2)\nReasoning models consistently benefit from external knowledge added in-context\non top of the reasoning enhancement; (3) Enhancing verbalized reasoning\nimproves LLMs' ability to surface task-relevant knowledge. Finally, we conduct\na lightweight analysis, comparing our science-focused data composition with\nconcurrent efforts on long CoT SFT, and release SciLit01, a strong 8B baseline\nfor scientific reasoning."}

In this paper, we conduct a\nthorough survey of PLS literature, and identify that the current standard\npractice for readability evaluation is to use traditional readability metrics,\nsuch as Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL). However, despite proven utility in\nother fields, these metrics have not been compared to human readability\njudgments in PLS. We evaluate 8 readability metrics and show that most\ncorrelate poorly with human judgments, including the most popular metric, FKGL.\nWe then show that Language Models (LMs) are better judges of readability, with\nthe best-performing model achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.56 with human\njudgments. Extending our analysis to PLS datasets, which contain summaries\naimed at non-expert audiences, we find that LMs better capture deeper measures\nof readability, such as required background knowledge, and lead to different\nconclusions than the traditional metrics. Based on these findings, we offer\nrecommendations for best practices in the evaluation of plain language\nsummaries. We release our analysis code and survey data."}

However, most systems remain constrained by a linear\nrequest-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in\nmulti-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm\nin which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces\n(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework\nleverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative\nrefinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic\nevaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares\ngenerative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,\ninteraction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and\nemotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces\nconsistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in\nover 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative\ninterfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction."}

Yet, scalable and\ngeneralizable execution-grounded environments remain scarce, limiting progress\nin training more capable ML agents. We introduce CTF-Dojo, the first\nlarge-scale executable runtime tailored for training LLMs with verifiable\nfeedback, featuring 658 fully functional Capture-The-Flag (CTF)-style\nchallenges containerized in Docker with guaranteed reproducibility. To enable\nrapid scaling without manual intervention, we develop CTF-Forge, an automated\npipeline that transforms publicly available artifacts into ready-to-use\nexecution environments in minutes, eliminating weeks of expert configuration\ntraditionally required. We trained LLM-based agents on just 486 high-quality,\nexecution-verified trajectories from CTF-Dojo, achieving up to 11.6% absolute\ngains over strong baselines across three competitive benchmarks: InterCode-CTF,\nNYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best-performing 32B model reaches 31.9% Pass@1,\nestablishing a new open-weight state-of-the-art that rivals frontier models\nlike DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. By framing CTF-style tasks as a\nbenchmark for executable-agent learning, CTF-Dojo demonstrates that\nexecution-grounded training signals are not only effective but pivotal in\nadvancing high-performance ML agents without dependence on costly proprietary\nsystems."}
